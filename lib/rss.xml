 <br><br>If you're experiencing test anxiety, you're far from alone. I had horrible test anxiety – it was to the point that my hands would be shaking uncontrollably halfway through a test and I'd have to stop writing entirely to just breathe. I've compiled some of the best tips I've come across, and I hope you find them helpful:<br>
<br>Learn your theory well enough to speed build with it

<br>Be honest with yourself and identify gaps in your theory early on


<br>Practice at speeds higher than you're testing at to build confidence
<br>Maintain good posture with your elbows tucked into your waist and your steno machine low enough so that your wrists are stabilized on your thighs
<br>Listen to audio that's faster than the speed you'll be testing at right before the exam

<br>Just listen and imagine how you would write the faster audio, don't actually write anything
<br>The test will seem manageable in comparison


<br>Have a consistent pre-test routine that includes some exercise to burn off adrenaline
<br>Find your inner zen during the test

<br>Remember to breathe - deep breathing/box breathing will slow down your heartrate and ground you

<br>Breathe in on "ready," and out on "begin"


<br>Don't look at your writer - your focus will be pulled away from what you need to write now to what you've already written/failed to write (and any errors you've made)


<br>Distract yourself just enough during the test so that the words flow through your fingers effortlessly

<br>Suck on a hard candy or chew gum
<br>Close your eyes and think of something that brings you peace and joy (a colour; a place; a friend, family member, or pet; or a memory)


<br>Accept and embrace the nerves

<br>There will probably be some nervousness (and its unfortunate symptoms) no matter what you do, so embrace it
<br>Some of the best public speakers and musicians deal with performance/test anxiety; there's no need to feel embarrassed or ashamed


<br>Write something for every word, even if it's gibberish

<br>You can't edit or guess at what you meant to write if there's nothing written


<br>Always transcribe!

<br>More often than not, we think we did worse than we actually did


<br>Tell yourself you got this

<br>It's nothing you haven't done in practice
<br>Remember that you're a steno star ⭐

<br>A ruptured aneurysm is when the wall of the artery bursts and causes hemorrhage

<br>Results in stroke, brain damage, coma, and death




<br>Arrythmia

<br>An irregular or abnormal heart rhythm


<br>Coronary artery disease

<br>Caused by plaques in the coronary arteries (build-up of fat and cholesterol deposits)

 <br><br><br>
<br>Gynecology: medical-surgical specialty dealing with female reproductive system in non-pregnant state
<br>Obstetrics: medical-surgical specialty dealing with female reproductive system in pregnant state
<br>OB/GYN: combination of gynecology &amp; obstetrics
<br>Gravida: pregnant

<br>Primigravida: woman who has been pregnant once
<br>Multigravida: woman who has been pregnant more than once


<br>Para: having given birth (regardless of whether stillbirth)
<br>Gravidity and parity
Gravida 1, para 1 = woman who has been pregnant once &amp; has given birth once
Gravida 3, para 2 = woman who has been pregnant 3 times &amp; has given birth twice
<br>
<br>Gestation period: length of pregnancy (about 40 weeks)

<br>For the first 8 weeks following conception, the baby is called an embryo
<br>After 8 week of pregnancy, the baby is called a fetus


<br><br>
<br>Placenta: organ that forms in the womb during pregnancy

<br>Allows for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the mother and the baby
<br>Secretes the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) at the start of pregnancy (detected by pregnancy tests)
<br>Stimulates the release of estrogen and progesterone
<br>Made of chorion (outer layer) and amnion (inner layer)


<br>Umbilical cord: lifeline between the mother and baby
<br>Amniotic sac: fluid-filled sac that protects the fetus
<br><img alt="pregnancy.svg" src="http://stenotab.tips/lib/media/pregnancy.svg"><br><br>
<br>Hormones secreted by the baby trigger labor
<br>Pull: the uterus contracts to dilate and pull the cervix over the baby's head

<br>The hormone oxytocin controls the contractions
<br>The amniotic sac opens ("water breaks") during labor


<br>Push: the uterus pushes the baby down the birth canal

<br>Pushing usually slows down as the baby's head crowns (emerges)


<br>Shape-shift: the mother and baby accommodate to each other's shape
<br>Turn: the baby spontaneously turns to allow delivery of the shoulders

<br>Breech delivery: the baby is turned around, buttocks first; must c-section


<br>Slide: the baby &amp; placenta slide out

<br>The umbilical cord gradually stops pulsing and can be safely cut a few minutes after delivery


<br>Shrink: the uterus shrinks down to prevent blood loss
<br>Apgar score: a rating to evaluate a newborn's health on a 2-point scale

<br>A = activity/muscle tone
<br>P = pulse
<br>G = grimace/reflex
<br>A = appearance/skin color
<br>R = respiration


<br><br>
<br>The uterus gradually returns to its pre-pregnancy size
<br>Mammary glands are stimulated to lactate (produce milk)
<br>Lasts 6-8 weeks
<br><br>
<br>Ectopic pregnancy

<br>Embryo implants outside the uterus (usually in fallopian tube)
<br>The pregnancy is not viable


<br>Hyperemesis gravidarum

<br>Extreme morning sickness
<br>Mother in danger of dehydration
<br>Possible causes: rising blood levels of HCG
<br>Treatment: IV fluids, anti-nausea meds, and avoiding triggers


<br>Gestational diabetes

<br>High blood sugar during pregnancy
<br>Goes back to normal after birth
<br>Manage with insulin
<br>Baby will not be born with diabetes; increases the risk of an extremely large baby


<br>Pregnancy-induced hypertension (pre-eclampsia)

<br>Severe high blood pressure and swelling of hands, face, &amp; feet
<br>Cause: retention of toxins in mother's system
<br>Can lead to convulsions in mother and problems for baby if untreated


<br>Premature birth

<br>A birth that takes place prior to 37 weeks' gestation
<br>Babies may have low birth weight &amp; jaundice and may spend time in the NICU


<br>Shoulder Dystocia

<br>Stuck shoulders
<br>Baby fails to rotate to allow shoulders to ease out or baby is just too large for the mother's pelvis and gets stuck
<br>Can cause excessive tearing of mother's tissues &amp; bleeding, injury to baby's shoulder and brain damage (due to lack of oxygen)


<br>Placenta previa

<br>The placenta is abnormally positioned so that is covers the cervix
<br>Blocks baby's exit from the womb
<br>Requires surgical delivery of baby


<br>Meconium aspiration syndrome

<br>Meconium: baby's first feces
<br>If meconium is passed in utero and the baby breathes it in during delivery, it can cause breathing issues for the baby


<br>Fetal distress

<br>Baby's heart rate becomes erratic or slows down


<br><br>
<br>Amniocentesis

<br>A needle is used to withdraw a sample of amniotic fluid from around the fetus
<br>Fluid is sent for genetic testing


<br>Continuous fetal monitoring

<br>If mother is anesthetized, she cannot cannot provide feedback about the progress of her labor or the baby’s condition
<br>An electronic fetal monitor is strapped to the mother's abdomen
<br>Electrodes may also be screwed into the baby's scalp


<br>Assisted delivery

<br>Forceps or a vacuum are applied to the baby’s head
<br>The baby is manually pulled out of the birth canal


<br>Episiotomy

<br>The mother's perineum is cut
<br>Obstetricians do this in complicated births (fetal distress, breech, shoulder dystocia, excessively large baby) and c-sections

<br>Obstetricians also used to (and some still do) this routinely to “prevent tearing” – new research shows natural tears heal better


<br>The incision must be surgically repaired


<br>Cesarean section

<br>Surgical delivery of baby


<br>The "husband stitch"
A medically unnecessary and harmful surgical procedure in which one/more additional sutures than necessary are used to repair a woman's perineum after being torn during childbirth
Its purpose was to tighten the opening of the vagina for the pleasure of the woman's partner during intercourse
It can cause a lifetime of pain and is not an approved medical procedure
It is considered malpractice without the woman's consent in Canada

 <br><br>
<br>Medical terminology describes:

<br>parts of the body
<br>locations of the body
<br>bodily functions
<br>surgical/clinical procedures
<br>diseases
<br>measurements, medical instruments, etc.


<br>Term analysis: an organized approach to learning medical terms
<br>Medical terms are made up of 3 word elements:

<br><a data-href="11 Roots" href="http://stenotab.tips/2-medical-terminology/11-roots.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">11 Roots</a>: the main part of the word; often refers to a body part
<br><a data-href="13 Prefixes" href="http://stenotab.tips/2-medical-terminology/13-prefixes.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">13 Prefixes</a>: the first part of the word that makes it more specific
<br><a data-href="12 Suffixes" href="http://stenotab.tips/2-medical-terminology/12-suffixes.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">12 Suffixes</a>: the end of the word


<br>Not all words have all 3 word elements
<br>Word with all 3 elements
Hypothyroidism
Prefix: hypo- (low/deficient)<br>
Root: thryroid/o (thyroid gland)<br>
Suffix: -ism (condition)
Meaning: condition where someone has a deficient thyroid gland
<br>Word with no root
Aphasia
Prefix: a- (without or not)<br>
Root: n/a<br>
Suffix: -phasia (speech)
Meaning: difficulty with language/speech
<br>Word with no prefix
Cardiology
Prefix: n/a<br>
Root: cardi/o (heart)<br>
Suffix: -ology (study of)
Meaning: study of the heart
<br>Word with 2 roots
Cardiomyopathy
Prefix: n/a<br>
Root 1: cardi/o<br>
Root 2: my/o<br>
Suffix: -pathy (disease)
Meaning: disease of the heart muscle
<br>
<br>Combining form: a root + a combining vowel
<br>Combining vowel: usually "o," but sometimes "i" (as in pelv/i) or "e"

<br>Purpose is to aid in pronunciation when:

<br>Root + root

<br>Cardiomyopathy or osteoarthritis


<br>Root + suffix when the suffix begins with a consonant

<br>Cardiology (cardi/o + -logy)






<br><br>Analyze the meaning of a medical term starting with the suffix]]></description><link>http://stenotab.tips/2-medical-terminology/7-basic-word-structure.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">2 Medical Terminology/7 Basic Word Structure.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tabea Adam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:34:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roots - Shorthand Outlines]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br>
<br>A set of rules created by a society that governs the conduct of its members, is recognized and enforced by the government, and includes a punishment if broken
<br>The rule of law:

<br>No one is above the law; everyone is subject to the law and treated equally
<br>The court system settles disputes; we don't take matters into our own hands


<br><img alt="law-categories.svg" src="http://stenotab.tips/lib/media/law-categories.svg"><br><br>
<br>Tells you what the rules are
<br>
<br>Public law deals with issues that affect society as a whole
<br>Private law deals with issues that affect private individuals or organizations
<br><br>
<br>Tells you how to apply or enforce those rules.
<br>Substantive vs. procedural
Substantive: You are charged with theft
Procedural:

<br>Police must have reasonable grounds to search and arrest you
<br>Police must inform you of your legal rights and give you a chance to contact counsel
<br>Police must file a charge specifying what you are accused of
<br>Police must release you or bring you before a judge or justice of the peace in order to speak to bail
<br>The trial must occur within a reasonable timeframe
<br>The trial must adhere to certain procedures and strict rules of evidence

 <br><br><br>
<br>The highest law (all other laws have to follow it)
<br>The Canadian Constitution:

<br>Sets out the division of powers (different levels of government have authority to pass laws)
<br>Contains the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (outlines the rights of individuals that the government cannot infringe upon within reasonable limits)

<br>Fundamental freedoms
<br>Democratic rights
<br>Mobility rights
<br>Legal rights
<br>Equality rights
<br>Language rights




<br><br>
<br>Made by elected lawmakers ("government-made law")
<br>A law becomes statute when it's passed (e.g., driving age)
<br><br><br>
<br>Based on past court decisions
<br>Decisions/rulings made by judges can set precedents, but it is flexible; judges can set new legal doctrines
<br>Stare decisis: the rule of precedent

<br>Lower courts must follow the decisions of higher courts (decisions are binding)
<br>Courts of equal rank should try to follow decisions (decisions are persuasive)


<br>Public &amp; private law in Canada
All of Canada follows the same public law (based on English law)
Quebec follows different private law (i.e., statute and common law) in the Civil Code of Quebec
<br><br>
<br>A quasi-judicial area of law that administrative boards and tribunals deal with

<br>National Parole Board
<br>Transportation Safety Board
<br>Workers' Compensation Board
<br>Alberta Labour Relations Board
<br>Gaming and Liquor Commission
<br>Alberta Energy and Utilities Board
<br>Information and Privacy Commissioner
<br>Human Rights and Citizenship Commission
<br>Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission

<br>Hybrid offence (aka dual procedure offence) is decided by Crown's election based on:

 <br><br><br>
<br>Determination of guilt
<br>Determination of punishment
<br><img alt="guilty-plea.svg" src="http://stenotab.tips/lib/media/guilty-plea.svg"><br><br>
<br>Denunciation

<br>To publicly condemn the unlawful conduct


<br>Deterrence<br>
- General - discourage the general public from committing the same/similar offence in the future<br>
- Specific - discourage the accused from committing the same/similar offence in the future<br>
Other purposes:
<br>Separate offenders from society if necessary
<br>Rehabilitate offenders
<br>Provide reparations for harm done
<br>Promote a sense of responsibility in offenders to victims and their community
<br><br>
<br>A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender
<br>The judge must attempt to impose a penalty which balances the competing interests of both the guilty party and society

<br>Sentence should be increased/reduced to account for relevant aggravating/mitigating circumstances relating to the offence/offender
<br>Statutory aggravating factors:

<br>Hate crime
<br>Domestic violence
<br>Victim under 18
<br>Abused position of trust/authority
<br>Gang/criminal organization
<br>Terrorism




<br>Similar sentences for similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances
<br>Combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh
<br>All available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered (particularly indigenous offenders)
<br>Sentencing is an individualized process within the framework of the Criminal Code and precedent
<br><br>
<br>A judge/justice should craft a sentence that embraces traditional indigenous sentencing principles where possible

<br>The more serious the offence, the less emphasis placed on these considerations
<br>R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 SCR 688
<br>R. v. Ipeelee, [2012] 1 SCR 433


<br><br>
<br>Sentencing hearing

<br>Can be quick and happen right after verdict
<br>OR adjourned to a later time/date


<br>After submissions of counsel, there are also be:

<br>Order from the judge for a presentence report to help them understand the individual circumstances of the offender/offence
<br>Victim impact statements
<br>Viva voce evidence
<br>Exhibits


<br><br>
<br>Imprisonment/custodial sentence

<br>One of the most severe sentences
<br>Sentencing judge is required to use less restrictive sanctions if possible
<br>Provincial institution: for sentences &lt; 2 years
<br>Federal institution: for sentences &gt; 2 years

<br>Imprisonment for life

<br>First-degree murder = automatic life - no eligibility for 25 years
<br>Second-degree murder = automatic life - no eligibility for 10-25 years (jury may make recommendation for parole ineligibility period)
<br>Other offences = no edibility for parole for 7 years




<br>Intermittent sentence: term of imprisonment typically served on weekends
<br>Conditional sentence (house arrest): option for sentences 2 years or less; served in the community
<br>Concurrent sentences: sentences imposed for separate crimes are served at the same time
<br>Consecutive sentences: sentences imposed for separate crimes are served one after the other


<br>Fine
<br>Probation
<br>Discharge
<br>Dangerous offender
<br>Long-term offender
<br><br>
<br>Conditional release of a prisoner before they've served their full custodial sentence

<br>To promote successful reintegration into society


<br>Remainder of sentence served in the community under supervision
<br>When a prisoner is eligible for release, the Parole Board of Canada will assess the risk posed and make a decision on whether to grant parole

<br>Temporary release
<br>Day parole
<br>Full parole
<br>Statutory release


<br>If parole is breached = fine is imposed
<br><br>
<br>May be imposed for any offence which doesn't have a minimum term of imprisonment
<br>If the accused doesn't have the money on hand, they can

<br>Ask for time to pay
<br>OR work off the fine under the fine option program


<br>Deemed days: a prescribed number of days the accused will spend in jail if they don't pay the fine (proportionate to the amount of the fine)
<br><br>
<br>Where an accused pleads guilty or is found guilty of an offence, the judge may choose to suspend the passing of sentence for a period of time

<br>Conviction entered
<br>Accused is placed on probation for a period of time and required to abide by conditions
<br>If probation order is followed successfully, no further punishment
<br>If probation order is breached

<br>Brought back to court and sentenced on the original charge
<br>and/or charged with criminal offence of breach of probation




<br><br><br>
<br>Community Service

<br>Work done in and for the benefit of the community
<br>Done to pay off a monetary fine or as a term of probation


<br>Restitution

<br>Payment made by the accused to cover actual expenses resulting from the commission of the offence to the victim (broken window, slashed tire...)


<br><br>
<br>Where an accused pleads guilty or is found guilty of an offence, the judge may grant a discharge instead of entering a conviction

<br>Must be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to public interest


<br>2 types of discharge:

<br>Absolute discharge

<br>Deemed not to have been convicted
<br>No criminal record


<br>Conditional discharge

<br>Accused is placed on probation for a period of time and required to abide by conditions
<br>If probation order is followed successfully, the discharge becomes absolute
<br>If probation order is breached

<br>Brought back to court and sentenced on the original charge
<br>and/or charged with criminal offence of breach of probation






<br>Reminder about criminal records
If accused is given a discharge = no criminal record
If accused is given a suspended sentence = they have a criminal record
<br><br>
<br>Dangerous, violent, and sexual predators who are likely to reoffend in the future
<br>Crown can make an application after conviction has been entered, and there would follow a lengthy sentencing hearing with viva voce evidence including psychological evidence

<br>If Crown is successful = accused is given an indeterminate term of imprisonment

<br>Remain in custody indefinitely
<br>Until the risk to reoffend no longer exists




<br><br>
<br>Used where an individual doesn't meet the criteria for a DO designation but has been convicted of a serious personal injury offence and is considered likely to re-offend
<br>If declared a LO, the accused will be sentenced to a specified term of incarceration
<br>Upon release, accused will be subject to a supervision order in the community for a max of 10 years
<br><br>
<br>Victim fine surcharge

<br>Monetary penalty paid by accused in addition to any other sentence


<br>DNA order

<br>Mandatory for primary designated offences
<br>Discretionary for secondary designated offences


<br>Firearms and weapons prohibition

<br>Sometimes mandatory


<br>Sex Offenders Information Registry (SOIRA) order

<br>Sometimes mandatory


<br><br>
<br>Canvassing Section 606(1.1)

<br>Accused is entering the guilty plea voluntarily,
<br>understands the consequences of pleading guilty, and
<br>understands that the Court is not bound by any argument made by counsel


<br>Joint submission

<br>Joint recommendation for sentence by Crown and defence

 <br><br><br>
<br>Pretrial hearings held in Provincial Court
<br>For offences proceeding by Indictment where the max penalty is 14 years or more
<br>To determine if there is sufficient evidence for the case to proceed to trial in the Court of King's Bench
<br>The accused may waive the preliminary inquiry with consent of the Crown

<br>The accused will be ordered to stand trial without the need for further evidence


<br>Direct indictment: allows Crown to bypass preliminary inquiry and proceed straight to trial

<br>Only in rare and exceptional circumstances because it takes away the accused's right to a preliminary inquiry

<br>Extremely long/complex cases
<br>To protect ongoing police investigations
<br>May cause significant harm to a witness (psychological or physical)
<br>A preliminary was commenced but not concluded
<br>There is deliberate delay of proceedings


<br>Requires written consent of the Attorney General


<br><img alt="prelim.svg" src="http://stenotab.tips/lib/media/prelim.svg"><br><br>
<br>This case established rules about disclosure as it relates to a fair trial
<br>Full disclosure: Crown must share all evidence (even evidence that could help defence and harm their own case) in a timely manner so as to let defence prepare for trial

<br>Before this, preliminary inquiries were held so that defence could learn about the Crown's case


<br><br>
<br>Do you already have enough disclosure?
<br>Do you want evidence "on the record"?
<br>Will a preliminary inquiry help the defense understand the evidence and witnesses better for trial?
<br>Could a preliminary inquiry help the Crown find and fix weaknesses in their case?
<br>Could the accused face new charges arising out of the evidence?
<br>Can a preliminary inquiry help to settle the case?
<br>Can the client afford both a preliminary inquiry and a trial?
<br><br>
<br>Crown only needs to establish a prima facie case

<br>There must be some evidence on each of the essential elements of the crime


<br>Any doubt in the mind of the Provincial Court judge during a preliminary inquiry is resolved in favour of the Crown
<br>How sufficient evidence works
IF the evidence called by the Crown is believed,<br>
COULD the accused be found guilty?
Yes - accused is ordered to stand trial<br>
No - accused is discharged
<br><br><br>
<br>All prospective witnesses are excluded from the courtroom until their testimony is done at trial

<br>This is done before the commencement of a trial or preliminary inquiry
<br>On the motion of one of the parties or the Court (the judge)


<br><br>
<br>Evidence taken at a preliminary inquiry shall not be published or broadcast or transmitted in any way until:

<br>The accused is discharged or preliminary or
<br>The trial in Court of King's Bench has ended


<br>Reasons for ban:

<br>Reading/watching media coverage may color a witness's testimony
<br>Media coverage could influence/bias potential jurors


<br>What if a witness is in the courtroom when they should have been excluded?
They may still testify BUT the judge may place less weight on their evidence
<br><br>
<br>Submissions made by counsel are not evidence
<br><br>
<br>To help the trier of fact understand the evidence to be presented

<br>Outlines the facts that they intend to prove
<br>Summarizes the theory of their case


<br><br>
<br>To persuade the trier of fact to decide in your favor

<br>Emphasizes evidence favorable to their case
<br>Emphasizes weaknesses in the other party's case
<br>Suggests how the law should be applied to the evidence


<br><br>
<br>The judge may order the accused to stand trial on a lesser included charge or additional charges arising from the evidence
<br>Criminal Code Section 541(2)
Do you wish to say anything in answer to these charges or to any other charges which might have arisen from the evidence led by the prosecution? You are not obliged to say anything, but whatever you do say may be given in evidence against you at your trial. You should not make any confession or admission of guilt because of any promise or threat made to you, but if you do make any statement, it may be given in evidence against you at your trial in spite of the promise or threat.

Crown would argue first
<br>
<br>Opening statements are atypical because the judiciary is capable of following the evidence and discerning the relevant information

<br>Only made when the case is particularly complex or complicated


<br>The accused is usually defence's first witness

<br>Because they must be present in the courtroom and cannot be subject to an order excluding witnesses (avoids influence from hearing other defence witnesses)
<br>The accused is not required to testify if defence calls evidence


<br>Defence is not requited to disclose their evidence to Crown even if they intend to call evidence except:

<br>Expert witness
<br>Alibi


<br><br>
<br>Separate category of evidence presented by Crown to refute or disprove defence evidence

<br>Keyboard commands/shortcut keys that allow you to move your cursor and access CaseCAT functions without needing to use your mouse
<br><br>
<br>Alt + underlined letter on menu button = mouse click
<br>Once in a menu, pressing another underlined letter = mouse click /#2
<br>Example
Alt + F = File menu opens<br>
With file menu open, press Z = zip &amp; email dialog box opens
<br>The same principle (press underlined letter) applies to inside dialog boxes<br><br>]]></description><link>http://stenotab.tips/4-transcript-production/1-keyboard-navigation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">4 Transcript Production/1 Keyboard Navigation.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tabea Adam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 05:59:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[CaseCAT File Structure]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Information storage system
<br><br><br>
<br>User Root Level
<br>User Name Level
<br>Case Level (optional)

<br>Use to organize related info

<br>Include files grouped in a case to declutter the Manage Jobs screen
<br>Files from a lengthy questioning for discovery because they share common speakers &amp; spellings


<br>Some are automatically created &amp; necessary to run CaseCAT

<br>System Files

<br>Personal Dictionary must be in this case


<br>Index Templates
<br>AutoArchive
<br>Layouts




<br>File Level

<br>Usually represents a single job


<br>Subfile Level

<br>Subunits of the file (see table below)
<br>Each file contains multiple subunits


<br><br>You can select to show/hide subfiles on the manage Jobs screen
View &gt; Show &gt; Show Subfiles

 <br><br>The psychology of writing realtime, "writing naked"<br>
<br>confidence is key

<br>know your software (know how to use macros, realtime commands, brief it, and live suggestions, etc.)
<br>know your equipment (in case you need to troubleshoot)
<br>know your dictionary (write down any new words you encounter in your daily life to add to your dictionary and refine your writing; get comfortable fingerspelling)


<br>practice makes perfect

<br>practice realtime every day (vocab building, fingerspelling, accuracy, speed, and striving for 100% translation, i.e., writing to correct words correctly - just because an outline translates doesn't mean it's the right word)
<br>analyze your mistakes (analyze and correct every word that doesn't translate from steno to English correctly - develop your dexterity needed for complicated outlines, adjust your machine, don't ignore untranslates)
<br>briefs (a bad brief is worse than no brief at all because it results in hesitation, must be easy to write and remember quickly, keep the brief and the word written out in full in your dictionary in case you can't remember the brief)
<br>start now! (treat every job like a realtime job just for yourself, always connect your CAT software)

 <br><br><br>Case CAT analyzes untranslates that contain characters you tend to drag or characters that are missing that you tend to drop in order to find a match to a steno outline in a dictionary being used to translate the file.<br>If Case CAT finds a match, the translated text will be surrounded by Drag/Drop Being and End format symbols.<br>For example, you tend to drag your final L. "Grate" is in your Personal Dictionary. You write GRAEULT. The untranslate will appear and "grate."<br>Specify the characters that you tend to drag and/or drop in Drag/Drop Analysis Details.<br>While editing, if Drag/Drop Analysis has translated the untranslate correctly, you can press Enter to confirm the translation.<br>To enable: Tools menu in Manage Jobs screen, Options, Translate, Translate, Input tab, select Drag/Drop Analysis, select Details, add keys you tend to drag and drop by clicking on the keyboard diagram (e.g., -L is commonly dragged)<br>TrueStroke Drag/Drop Analysis<br>
If using:<br>
<br>Luminex via USB/Wi-Fi connection
<br>Diamante via USB/Wi-Fi connection
<br>Wave via USB connection<br>
Cast CAT analyzes untranslates during realtime translation using TrueStroke data located in the Steno X-subfile to match a steno outline in a dictionary being used to translate.
<br>TrueStroke Drag/Drop has priority over Drag/Drop Analysis if both options are selected.<br>While editing, if TrueStroke Drag/Drop has translated the untranslate correctly, you can press Enter to confirm the translation.<br>To enable: Tools menu in Manage Jobs screen, Options, Translate, Translate, Input tab, select TrueStroke Drag/Drop Analysis. No other action required.<br><br>When active, Case CAT translate, by default, steno outlines accidentally stroked with a dragged letter -G, -S, or -D as a suffix letter tucked inside a steno outline.<br>Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker allows you to select whether dragged steno should be considered a suffix or a word.<br>Suffix Drag<br>
Suffix Drag applies the suffix strokes -G, -S, -Z, or -D to single-stroke untranslates when the dragged letter is the last character in the outline.<br>The translated text will be surrounded by Suffix Drag Begin and End format symbols.<br>For example, "blog" is defined in your Personal Dictionary, but the steno stroke BLOGD is not. The untranslate will appear as "blogged."<br>Set Suffix Drag Options by clicking the Details button. Use -S, -Z, or both for a plural suffix. Tuckable suffixes are permitted. For example, the untranslated SLAOEGT would translate as "sleeting."<br>Phrase Maker<br>
For example, let's say the steno stroke TPH-GT is not defined in the dictionary. However, you have TPH defined as "in" and -GT is set as a "word" type in your Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker Options as the word "this."<br>With the Word option in Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker, you can have TPH-GT translate as "in this" even though it is not defined in your dictionary as a single stroke.<br>Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker only applies to one-stroke words in which steno characters can be added as a suffix. Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker options allow you to add other steno characters you want Case CAT to consider a suffix.<br>The Plural Endings Options allow you to use the final S, final Z, or both for plural endings. To confirm the combined words are spelled correctly, set the Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker Spell Check option for the steno outline.<br>If Spell Check is active, Case CAT checks the newly combined word to confirm the combined word is spelled correctly. If a correctly spelled word is not found, Case CAT tries the next possible suffix to find an actual word. This may result in a correctly spelled word but not the word intended. If Case CAT does not find a correctly spelled word with an added suffix, the steno outline remains an untranslate and no conversion takes place. The Spellchecked option has no influence on phrases created by Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker.<br>If also using TrueStroke Drag/Drop or Drag/Drop Analysis, TrueStroke Drag/Drop and then Drag/Drop Analysis takes priority.<br>To enable: Tools menu in Manage Jobs screen, Options, Translate, Input tab, select Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker, select Details, add a new entry by clicking on the blank row at the bottom of the list<br>Some common phrasing:<br><br>Delete Repeated Q/A/C<br>
If multiple Qs, As, or Colloquy paragraphs (with the same name) are written on right after another with no text in between, Case CAT will automatically delete the empty paragraphs so only one paragraph displays.<br>For example, if you write the steno outline defined as &lt;Question&gt; five times in a row without text, only one Q will display in the transcript.<br>Use Smart Quotes<br>
By selecting this option, you only need one dictionary definition for a quotation mark. When you write the steno defined as a quotation mark (") the first time in a paragraph, Case CAT inserts an opening quote. When you write that same steno outline again, Case CAT inserts a closing quote.<br>If you wrote the steno defined as quotation mark once and did not write it again to close the quotation, Case CAT automatically puts a closing quote at the end of the current paragraph style<br>For CACR students, this option should be selected.<br>Use Smart Parentheses<br>
By selecting this option, you only need one dictionary definition for a parenthesis or bracket. When you write the steno defined as the open parenthesis or bracket the first time, Case CAT inserts an open parenthesis or bracket. When you write the same steno outline a second time, Case CAT inserts a closed parenthesis or bracket.<br>If you wrote the steno defined as open parenthesis or bracket once but did not write it again, Case CAT automatically inserts the closed parenthesis or bracket at the end of the current paragraph.]]></description><link>http://stenotab.tips/5-writing-realtime/3-translate-options.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5 Writing Realtime/3 Translate Options.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tabea Adam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:00:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Advanced Translate Options]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br>This feature works in conjunction with Translate's Drag/Drop Analysis feature and at least one steno character is selected as either a dragged or dropped character. If during translation the result of the Drag/Drop Analysis would still result in an untranslate, the Second Chance Drag/Drop feature will apply other steno characters to find a match.

 <br><br><br>Fingerspelling involves writing a word one letter at a time using alphabets on your steno writer instead of writing a word with phonetic outlines. When you hear a word that isn't in your dictionary, you will need to spell it out.<br>Sound cumbersome? It certainly can be and often is. The good news is that it is a skill that can be practiced and even perfected, and it can become a valuable tool in your realtime career.<br>While fingerspelling is not a substitute for a solid, conflict-free theory and a good workign set of prefixes, suffixes, and word roots, it is an excellent way to handle the occasional oddball word or name that will will inevitably hear on the job.<br>Once you've determined how you will write your fingerspelling alphabet, it's time to practice it. Just as you needed to drill yourself on shorthand speed, you probably will also need to do the same with your fingerspelling skills. Practice at home with random words picked out of the dictionary; experiment with it while practicing for accuracy.<br>Start with small words and work up to longer ones. Work to achieve a steady rhythm as you spell, rather than frantic, jerky bursts. You'll be surprised how quickly that word can come out, if you don't panic! Try to think of fingerspelling as just another bunch of outlines and jump right in.<br><br>You already have three alphabets in your personal dictionary. Make entries for the fourth alphabet, lowercase letters with parentheses.<br>]]></description><link>http://stenotab.tips/5-writing-realtime/5-fingerspelling.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5 Writing Realtime/5 Fingerspelling.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tabea Adam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:00:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Power Defines]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br>What is it?<br>
Case CAT facilitates realtime writing to enable realtime and translation commands such as common number conversion, mode control, and define strokes. These commands allow you to perform editing and software functions from your steno machine.<br>The Realtime Commands Dictionary is a default file in your System Files case. You can modify any or all of the entries to match your steno theory and then copy/paste the entries into your Personal Dictionary or another dictionary you may use when writing realtime.<br>Why?<br>
<br>Clean realtime
<br>Less editing time
<br>Create definitions on the fly
<br><br>What does Power Define do?<br>
Allows you to create D, J, or K define entries from your writer during a realtime session.<br>For example?<br>
The witness refers to his business partner, Broderick Klabber. You can create a Personal Dictionary entry for Broderick and a job or case dictionary entry for Klabber.<br>How do I do it?<br>
Getting ready:<br>
<br>
In System Files, open the Realtime Commands Dictionary. Locate and highlight the {Define} and {Scan Define} entries. Right mouse click and select to copy the entry to your Personal Dictionary.

<br>
Note that the entries in power define under System Files should not be added to your Personal Dictionary. Make sure the entries for lower and uppercase letters matches your theory.

<br>
In System Files, open the Power Define Dictionary. Review the entries to become familiar with the steno and commands.

<br>
Revise the lowercase alphabet steno outlines to be A, B, C*, etc.

<br>Note that entries in the Power Define Dictionary are only used when the Power Define dialog box is open.

 <br><br><br>What does it do?<br>
A realtime feature that suggests conflict-free brief forms for words and phrases as you are writing. When you write three or more steno strokes, Case CAT generates a brief form or reminds you of an existing brief form and displays it in the Brief It dialog pane.<br>For example?<br>
You have written "personal chequing account" twice. Case CAT suggests P*K as a brief, which appears in the Brief It pane on a yellow background. You like the suggestions and begin writing P*K, and it translates as "personal chequing account."<br>You write "joint account" out. Case CAT reminds you that J-KT is a brief in your Personal Dictionary. The reminder appears in the Brief It pane on a green background.<br>How do I do it?<br>
Enabled Brief It during realtime translation:<br>
<br>Press Ctrl t to open the Translate dialog box and press Alt p (Options).
<br>Click the Realtime tab.
<br>In the Realtime Aids section, select Brief It.
<br>In a realtime file, open the Brief It pane by pressing Alt v, e, t (View, Panes, Brief It). When you want to use a suggested brief, simply write the steno.
<br><br><br>What does it do?<br>
A realtime feature that automatically offers translation suggestions when an untranslate displays in the transcript. You have the option to ignore, replace, or define the suggestion from the writer during realtime or with a keyboard command.<br>For example?<br>
You misstroke and write SHRAOUR. In the Brief It pane, "sure" is the first and correct suggestion. You write a realtime command from your writer to replace the untranslate.<br>How do I do it?<br>
Enable Live Suggestions during realtime translation:<br>
<br>Press Ctrl t to to open the Translate dialog box and press Alt p (Options).
<br>Click the Realtime tab.
<br>In the Realtime Aids section, select Live Suggestions.<br>
Add the Live Suggestions realtime commands to your Personal Dictionary.
<br>In System Files, open the Realtime Commands Dictionary.
<br>Select each of the {Replace With LS#} and {Define With LS#} entries. Right mouse click and copy to your Personal Dictionary.
<br>In your Personal Dictionary, modify the steno as desired. If you select to display more than three Live Suggestions in your options, create new dictionary entries and LS4 and LS5.<br>
In a realtime file, open the Brief It pane by pressing Alt v, e, t (View, Panes, Brief It).
<br>Write the steno stroke for the {Replace With LS#} or {Define With LS#} command that corresponds to the correct Live Suggestion.<br>Tips and Tricks<br>
At least four translated words or phrases need to be written after the untranslate before a Live Suggestion will be offered.<br>Only one Live Suggestion is offered at a time. The suggestions display until the next untranslate is written.<br>Live Suggestions appear on a light blue background in the Brief It pane.<br>One you select a Live Suggestion, the background color turns gray and the remaining suggestions appear crossed out. To hide suggestions that were not selected, deselect the Rejected option in the Brief It pane filter options.<br>You can also right click a Live Suggestion in the Brief It pane and select Replace with this Suggestion or Define this Suggestion. Double clicking a Live Suggestion will replace the untranslate.<br><br>Modify Brief It Options<br>
<br>From the All Options dialog box, under Edit Panes, select Brief It.
<br>From the Brief It pane, click the Options icon.
<br>From Manage Jobs, press Alt t, o, e, b (Tools, Options, Edit, Brief It).
<br>From Edit, press Alt t, o, Enter, b (Tools, Options, Pane Options, Brief It).
<br>Show Phonetic Steno<br>
Check this box to have Brief It display steno as it sounds. For example, the suggested brief for "Yoko Ono" would appear as Y*O as opposed to KWR*O.<br>When Show Phonetic Steno is selected, steno in the Cat Scratch Text/Steno section will also display phonetically.<br>Only Suggest 1 Stroke Briefs<br>
Check this box to have Brief It suggest only one-stroke Suggested briefs. By default, Brief It always suggests a one-stroke brief with the asterisk before suggesting a two-stroke brief.<br>Selecting this option also affects Reminder and Personal briefs. For example, you write "neurotoxicity" in four or five strokes. When this option is active, Brief It does not remind you that you have TPHAOUR/TOX in your Personal Dictionary as a two-stroke entry.<br>Write Twice to Define<br>
Brief It, by default, automatically creates a J-Define or a K-Define the first time you use a Suggested brief. Checking this box requires you to consecutively write a brief twice before Brief It creates a J-Define or K-Define. You may want to use this option to try a Suggested brief before making it a definition.<br>For example, Brief It suggests A*BT for "Abbott Labs." If the Write twice to Define option is active, you would need to write A*BT/A*BT to have Case CAT create the global. Once defined, you write A*BT for "Abbott Labs" for the remainder of the job.<br>Define to Case Dictionary<br>
Check this box to place a Suggested brief in the case dictionary once it is written. If the current job is not in a case, then the brief is placed in the job dictionary.<br>Personal/Reminders Only<br>
Check this box to display only Reminder and Personal briefs in the Brief It dialog pane. Suggested briefs are not created.<br>1 Stroke Reminders for 2 Strokes<br>
Check this box to have Brief It offer one-stroke Reminders or Personal briefs when writing two-stroke entries. For example, if you write "I don't" in two strokes and there is a one-stroke version in your Personal Dictionary, Brief It shows the one-stroke brief as a Reminder.<br>Auto Open Brief It<br>
Check this box to automatically display the Brief It dialog pane when starting realtime. By default, this option is selected.<br>Send Used Briefs to Cat Scratch<br>
Check this box to automatically send a Suggested brief you use to the Steno/Text section of the Cat Scratch dialog pane.<br>Steno Include/Exclude<br>
Displays the Brief It Options table where you can modify the Require and Exclude entries.<br>The Require entry contains the steno character or steno combination to be included in every Suggested brief. There is only one Require entry.<br>Exclude entries contain steno characters or steno combinations to exclude from every Suggested brief. You can have multiple Exclude entries.<br>Personal Briefs<br>
Personal Briefs are entries which are created prior to translation and are stored in the Briefs.txt file in the System Files case. A default Briefs.txt file exists for each user.<br>Creating entries in the Briefs.txt file allows you to store words and phrases along with the brief form without placing them in a dictionary. For example, you got some good ideas for briefs from an article in the JCR but you're not certain you want to put them in your Personal Dictionary.<br>Common Words<br>
The CommonWords.txt file contains a list of words the Brief It does not consider when looking for words and phrases for brief suggestions. Is a phrase is written that begins or ends with a word from the CommonWords.txt file, no brief is suggested. For example, by default the word "about" is in the CommonWords.txt file. When a phrase is written that begins or ends with the word "about" and no Reminder or Personal brief exists for the word or phrase, Brief It does not suggest a brief.<br>Allow Briefs with Numbers<br>
Check this box to have Brief It offer suggestions for repeated dollar amounts or addresses.<br>An additional option is available in the Steno Include/Exclude list where a Required for Numbers entry is available. For example if the Required for Numbers entry is EU and you write 23925 several times throughout the transcript, Brief It might suggest 23EU9. (EU is the default steno entry.)<br>Be default, the following number/steno key combinations are excluded in the Brief Include/Exclude Options: #1S, #2K, #3W, #4R, #6-R, #7-B, #8-G, #9-S<br>To prevent any number bar number from being suggested, press Ctrl + i and type # and press Enter.<br>Allow Double First Syllable<br>
Check this box to have Brief It offer the first syllable of the text (single word or phrase) written twice as the suggested brief. For example, the word "fluorescent" is used multiple times in the transcript. You write "fluorescent" in multiple strokes and Brief It suggests TPHROR/TPHROR.<br>When you have both Write Twice to Define and Allow Double First Syllable options selected, if the suggested brief has two identical strokes, Brief It will behave as if "Write Twice to Define" option was not active. In other words, you do not need to write the brief four times to use it. If the brief is one stroke or is multiple (not identical) strokes, briefs will need to be written twice to be used.<br>No Nag List<br>
Check this box to designate words or phrases that should no longer be offered as a suggestion or a reminder. For example, you have the phrase "of the" in your Personal Dictionary, but sometimes you write it in two strokes. You do not want Brief It to remind you of the phrase.<br>From the Brief It pane, right click an entry or highlight multiple entries and then right click. Select Send Text to No Nag List. Alternatively, select No Nag List in Brief It options and type the text portion of the entry.<br><br>Insert Oops when replacing with a live suggestion<br>
Select to add an &lt;Oops&gt; format symbol (category 10) whenever you select to replace an untranslate with a Live Suggestion. This enables you to scan to Live Suggestion replacements and confirm change. You can also view each instance in the Hotspots pane.<br>Number of Suggestions<br>
Select how many suggestions should be offered in the Brief It pane. Select from 2 to 5 suggestions. The default number of suggestions is 3.<br>Dictionary Defines go to<br>
Select the destination dictionary you want a defined suggestion to go to when using the {Define With LS#} commands. When this option is set to case dictionary and the transcript is not in a case, entries will go to the job dictionary.<br>Show "translated" text as first Live Suggestions<br>
By default, this option is active and Drag/Drop, Suffix Drag, and phonetically translated text will be the first choice in the Live Suggestion list.<br>]]></description><link>http://stenotab.tips/5-writing-realtime/8-brief-it!-and-live-suggestions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5 Writing Realtime/8 Brief It! and Live Suggestions.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tabea Adam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:00:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Phonetic Translation]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>What is it?<br>
When active, Case CAT phonetically translates steno outlines when no match is found in any dictionary used for translation. This prevents the display of untranslates on the realtime screen.<br>Put another way:<br>
The Phonetic Table contains steno outlines and phonetic text equivalents. When the Advanced Translate option, Phonetic untranslates display as words is set to No and you select the Phonetic Translation option or use the Toggle Phonetic Mode during realtime, steno outlines normally displayed as untranslates translate phonetically based on the text equivalent entry in the Phonetic Table and Suggested briefs based on your Brief It options.<br>Example<br>
The proceedings include the name Jaymes. If no dictionary entry for the steno SKWRAEUPLZ exists, the steno outline displays as an untranslate. Using the Phonetic Table, each steno combination matches to the text equivalent. The result displays as JAIMZ in the transcript instead of SKWRAEUPLZ, as shown:<br>SKWR&nbsp; = J<br>
A = A<br>
EU = I<br>
PL&nbsp; = M<br>
-Z = Z<br>When the Advanced Translate option “Phonetic untranslates display as words” is set to Yes, Case CATalyst use a phonetic algorithmic logic to determine the intended pronunciation. The Phonetic Table is not used.<br>How do I do it?<br>
In the Input tab of Translation Options, you can have Phonetic Translation automatically turn on when you start a realtime file.<br>Alternatively, you can add the Toggle Phonetic Mode entry to your personal dictionary and turn it on or off directly from your machine.<br>{Toggle Phonetic Mode} = TOPB/TOPB<br>How does it work?<br>The phonetic table in System Files contains steno outlines and phonetic text equivalents. Steno outlines translate phonetically based on the text equivalent in the phonetic table.<br>/PHROFRP = Plomp<br>Phonetic untranslates display as words - Yes/No<br>Select Yes to phonetically translate single stroke untranslates during realtime using algorithmic logic to determine the intended pronunciation. Case CATalyst bases the logic on Stenograph Theory and the WinterTree Spell Check, Stedman’s Medical and Black’s Legal wordlists to create a word with the most accurate spelling of the phonetically sounded word. Phonetic translation applies when no dictionary match is found in any dictionary used for translation.]]></description><link>http://stenotab.tips/5-writing-realtime/9-phonetic-translation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5 Writing Realtime/9 Phonetic Translation.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tabea Adam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:00:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Websites and Email Addresses]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>What is it?<br>It's a simultaneous editing feature which allows sharing of text, globals, and audio with one or more scopists or proofreaders while the reporter is writing realtime.<br>For example?<br>A reporter begins a realtime file and invites their scopist to join. The scopist accepts the invitation, and the realtime file opens on their computer. The scopist has access to the audio and can perform all editing functions. Any changes made by the reporter or the scopist are reflected on both systems.<br>What do I need?<br>
<br>RealTeam or Cloud Backup login
<br>Contact information for the scopist or proofreader
<br>Internet connection with or without a local network
<br>Edge for Case CAT Support Plan
<br>How do I do it?<br>
<br>Each participant logs in to RealTeam by selecting RealTeam Ready from the file menu/RealTeam toolbar
<br>The reporter (host) begins a realtime file and invites each participant to the RealTeam session from the Translate dialog box/RealTeam toolbar/File menu
<br>Each participant will hear a "ringing" sound when the invitation is received, and the Case CAT icon will flash on the Windows taskbar. The RealTeam dialog box will display the email address of the host and the path and filename where the transcript will be opened.
<br>Once the invitation is accepted, each participant will immediately receive the entire available text file and audio file. The participants can begin editing the file.
<br><br>Tips &amp; Tricks<br>Open the Connected Users pane to display the status of each participant.<br>If you are editing right up against the realtime text, the audio playback may stop because there isn't audio available yet. Select Play Audio again after a few seconds.<br>If there is more than one scopist or proofreader working on the same file, one person should be designated as the team's leader and determine who is responsible for editing which portions of the job. It's recommended that each participant leave hidden text or visible notes at stopping or starting points to avoid gaps or duplication of efforts.<br>Additional Notes<br>The participant's system will adopt the file structure and naming convention as established by the host.<br>Settings such as page/normal view, colors, and panes display are based on the individual user settings.<br>Each participant's name will display on the screen to indicate their cursor location along with their current page number/location. If a participant is editing above the current text on the screen, their cursor (name) displays in the upper left-hand corner of your realtime screen. If their cursor is below the current text on the screen, their cursor displays in the lower left-hand corner of the realtime screen.<br>Double clicking a fellow participant's cursor position will shift your view to their position in the file.]]></description><link>http://stenotab.tips/5-writing-realtime/11-realteam.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5 Writing Realtime/11 RealTeam.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tabea Adam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:00:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[CasePrep]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>What does it do?<br>Enables you to quickly and thoroughly prepare for your next job. Case Prep compares transcripts and other documents against one or more dictionaries to determine which words are and are not in your dictionaries. Case Prep uses this information to<br>
<br>generate a Dictionary Builder List for words and phrases that are not in the selected dictionaries or your Personal Dictionary
<br>generate a Heads Up List of words and phrases that you will want to define and possibly brief.
<br>For example?<br>The RCTT lawsuit is coming to trial, and you expect daily transcript to be ordered. You are going to do some prep work so that your translation is as clean as possible. You have been provided discovery transcripts from colleagues, some on Case CAT and some on a different software. You are also planning to do some internet research about suitable soil types for construction. You run Case Prep and quickly mine the relevant information from all sources. You then create dictionary entries and generate briefs.<br>How do I do it?<br>
<br>Gather your resources. Restore Case Cat transcripts to your user. Text or PDF documents which contain helpful information can be saved anywhere on your computer.<br>
Supported file types are Cat text files (.sgngl), Cat BCS files (.sgcap), ASCIIs (.txt), .PDFs, .PTX, and/or .XMEF<br>
If a colleague on different CAT software provides a file in the RTF/CRE format, import the file into Case Cat.<br>
If you are obtaining information from email or the internet, copy and paste the text into a Case Cat file.
<br>From Manage Jobs, click Tools, Case Prep. Complete the steps as prompted in the wizard.
<br>Tips &amp; Tricks<br>You can print the contents of the Brief It pane by clicking the Printer icon on the Brief It pane.<br>If you want different results (one list containing phrases sorted by and one list containing words and phrases not in the dictionary sorted by words then phrases), you can run Case Prep more than once.<br>A Microsoft Word document can be saved as a plain .TXT file and used with Case Prep.<br>Phrases are generated from transcripts (.sgngl) or caption (.sgcap) files whether there is underlying steno outlines or not. ASCII and PDF files will only generate words, so it may be preferable to paste the contents of an ASCII or PDF into a Case CAT text file.]]></description><link>http://stenotab.tips/5-writing-realtime/12-caseprep.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5 Writing Realtime/12 CasePrep.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tabea Adam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 02:04:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[CART Captioning]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br>
<br>display options may include computers, monitors, large screens, and mobile devices
<br>we can share our speech to text display anywhere
<br>many web conferencing platforms allow captioners to provide captions for online meetings (host must assign closed captioning privileges to the captioner)
<br>one to one captioner to client experience is when a captioner sits next to the client and shares a display with the client (choose a clean layout - no line numbers, normal view, hidden menu bars, customize color, font style, and font size)
<br><br>What is it?<br>
<br>An alternative to sharing the writer’s screen is Output to CARTView which allows the writer to display the text on a second monitor or screen.
<br>CARTView (local display) is available in the Output To: field in the Translate dialog box. Outputting to CARTView displays a separate window which can display on your computer or you can drag the window to another monitor or computer screen. The CARTView window displays text with no toolbars or menus.
<br>The display may be customized by changing the color of the text, background, font style and size, background transparency, line spacing and the position of the window. You can save the CARTView settings to the Alternate User Settings feature.
<br>Editing changes to the realtime screen are reflected on the CARTView screen. If the CARTView window is displayed on another monitor/computer, you can use editing features that display dialog boxes on the realtime screen without displaying the dialog boxes on the CARTView window. For example, you can use the Power Define feature to easily define from your writing machine or you can have the Brief It pane open in your software.
<br>The Case CATalyst CARTView Settings Icon is available in the Windows System Tray. When selected, the icon displays the CARTView screen settings such as font, transparency, color, etc. The system tray icon makes it easy to control the CARTView settings when you do not have instant access to the CARTView window.
<br>For example, let’s say you are in the back of a large convention room with CARTView displaying on a large screen in the front of the room when you realize you need to change the color or the size of the text to make it more readable. By clicking the Case CATalyst CARTView Settings icon, you will instantly have access to the CARTView settings. No need to go to the front of the room to make adjustments.
<br><br>What is it?<br>
<br>Parentheticals are commonplace in CART and should be used to indicate environmental sounds that may or may not be apparent to the consumer.
<br>Style<br>
<br>Parentheticals should appear in title case with an open bracket, space, \&lt;text&gt;, space, close bracket.
<br>Defined in the dictionary as:<br>
<br>\&lt;Parenthetical&gt;
<br>(
<br>\&lt;Sticky Space&gt;
<br>\&lt;Caption: KeepCaseOn&gt;
<br>Cheers and Applause
<br>\&lt;Caption: KeepCaseOff&gt;
<br>\&lt;Sticky Space&gt;
<br>)
<br>
<br>A parenthetical should appear independently on a new line
<br>No punctuation is applied to the parenthetical
<br>Note: The ( Inaudible ) parenthetical is used when the writer cannot hear what has been said and stays in line with the text

 <br><br><br>What is broadcast captioning?<br>
<br>on-screen display of text for spoken dialogue and environmental sounds
<br>as assistive technology which afford "effective communication access" for HOH consumers
<br>a captioner uses a steno machine, computer, and captioning software to render instant speech-to-text translation to an encoder at a remote location to provide text synchronized with television broadcast audio
<br>Caption formats:<br>
<br>Rollup: used mainly for live captioned events
<br>Popup: used mainly for pre-scripted media
<br>Subtitles: translate dialogue into another language. Do not include "environmental" sounds
<br>Captioned events:<br>

<br><br>CATalyst Broadcast Captioning Suite (BCS) is designed for steno caption providers. It utilizes integrated live display and scripted program features. A variety of windowing options allow you to view your realtime translation, make corrections to the translation, preview the text that displays on the viewer’s television and organize your story scripts. Additional features include the ability to view your vertical notes, session selections, and the status of the captioning mode.<br>Click (the BCS Captioning button) on the Function Bar or click Function, Broadcast Captioning Suite (or press Alt+u, b).<br>Captioning Options<br>
Caption Translate options are a group of settings that affect how CATalyst BCS translates steno outlines. You set translate options on the Options tab in the Caption Options dialog box prior to starting a session or during a captioning session using the Options feature on the Setup menu. Options settings remain the same until you change them.<br>There are three translate options specific to BCS.<br>Remove Single Empty Paragraph<br>
<br>Suppress the blank line generated when a steno outline with a paragraph style is followed by a stroke defined with a paragraph style at the beginning of the definition.
<br>Replace Q&amp;A With &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>Converts Question and Answer format symbol to chevrons (&gt;&gt;).
<br>Hold Strokes<br>
<br>When active, steno outlines are held before displaying the translated text on the live display. CATalyst BCS holds the steno until it finds the longest dictionary match plus the specified number of additional strokes. Once a longest match is found, BCS re-translates the steno outlines to display the longest match text. If no steno is written for a specified number of seconds, then the translated text or steno on the screen displays regardless of the longest match.
<br>For example, let's say your Longest match plus X strokes option is set to 3 and the Held for X seconds option is set to 2. You write a four-stroke word which is a longest match plus three more strokes. When the longest match plus the additional strokes are written, CATalyst pushes out the translation. If translation isn't done with the longest match, it will hold back the translation for 2 seconds. This creates a “buffer zone” to allow for corrections in the Realtime pane.

 <br><br>Three areas court reporters may be asked to write realtime:<br>
<br>Questionings
<br>Trials
<br>Hearings (quasi-judicial proceedings)
<br>
<br>each participant has a screen available to them in order to view the live transcript
<br>transcripts are ordered on a daily copy basis (transcript is written, edited, and proofread all on the same day)

<br>reporters often work with a team to facilitate this turnaround


<br>primarily use wireless connections to connect all the computers using a LAN (local area network) or a WAN (wide area network)
<br>participants can be present or remote
<br>reporters are sometimes expected to provide devices for the live transcript feed; sometimes participants bring their own device
<br>realtime reporting is verbatim
<br>The second type of realtime is CART<br>
<br>no opportunity to interrupt the speaker
<br>generally, no editing and no transcripts
<br>bulk of the work is done beforehand, preparing for the job
<br>clients may request a transcript

<br>an additional fee should be charged
<br>must clarify with client whether they are looking for a rough draft or a fully edited transcript


<br>strive for verbatim to afford the same experience to hard of hearing, but paraphrasing is acceptable when necessary
<br>The third type of realtime is broadcast captioning<br>
<br>output captions to an encoder at the television station through a telephone line or an internet connection
<br>paraphrasing is necessary when speech is too fast (audience wouldn't be able to read fast enough to keep up)

 <br><br>
<br>“Seek to understand before being understood.”

<br>Steven Covey


<br>Use empathic listening as a base character to inspire openness and trust,
<br>Listen through their frame of reference.
<br>Diagnose before you prescribe.
<br>By judging first, you will never fully understand.
<br><br>
<br>Maintain self-awareness

<br>Be aware of emotions and motives
<br>Are you being judgmental or too opinionated


<br>Self-Regulation

<br>Emotional stability and information processing in difficult situations. Anger, frustration, grief get in the way of effective communication. Use proper tone.


<br>Empathy

<br>Active listening


<br>It is important to be receptive to feedback
<br>Learn and adapt to change
<br><br>
<br>It is all the non-verbal communication we make – both conscious and unconscious.
<br>Some studies suggest that only 7% of our judgments are based on what we actually say. These studies were usually taken when the body language was disagreeing with what was being said.
<br>People believe far more by what they see than by what they hear.
<br>You can change your body language to show empathy and to influence someone by slowing down your movements or taking away any unintended aggressive body language of your own.
<br>You can learn to relax, calm and excite other people purely by the way you hold yourself, the way you move and the way you interact.
<br>Aggressive body language

<br>Hands on hips
<br>Legs too wide
<br>Invading personal space, too close
<br>Aggressive gesturing (finger pointing)
<br>Standing over someone
<br>Overly firm handshake
<br>Staring

<br>Defensive body language

<br>Crossed arms or legs
<br>Hunched shoulders
<br>Poor eye contact
<br>Leaning away
<br>Tight voice

<br>Nervous body language

<br>Nail biting
<br>Dry throat (swallowing, coughing)
<br>Blushing
<br>Weak handshake
<br>Avoiding eye contact

<br>Bored body language

<br>Looking around the room
<br>Looking at watch
<br>Drumming fingers
<br>Yawning
<br>Shifting weight
<br>Rubbing face

<br>Open &amp; interested body language

<br>Firm handshake
<br>Good eye contact
<br>On the same level
<br>Confident stance
<br>Confident, chosen gestures
<br>Showing interest (head not, slight lean in)

<br><br>
<br>Clear and concise expression of thoughts •Articulate, correct use of language, expressive
<br>Makes good eye contact with others while speaking
<br>Well-organized, complete, and courteous presentation of thoughts
<br>Consistently holds the attention of others
<br><br>
<br>Work begins before the conversation itself (mental preparation)

<br>Courage, patience, confidence, vision success, reframe negatives


<br>The approach

<br>The manner in which you engage can tip the conversation to success.
<br>Empathy: Seek to understand before being understood.

<br>After you heard the other side, react with empathy, share information and your point of view, and turn the conversation back to the other person.


<br>Collaboration, partnering, win/win

<br>Don’t act like this is a competition or fight. Treat the conversation as a problem you are trying to work through.


<br>Maintain their self-esteem and yours.

<br>Speak and act like the other person is always feeling respected.




<br>Build rapport

<br>Stay adult
<br>Build rapport
<br>Manage tone of voice
<br>Keep speed of speech slow, volume low
<br>Take care of body language


<br>What you say

<br>No blame
<br>Withhold judgment
<br>Begin neutrally
<br>Ask for more information or other's point of view
<br>Respond by acknowledging their concerns
<br>Share your point of view after hearing theirs


<br>Power tools

<br>Apologize and road repair

<br>Apologize for whatever you contributed to a situation
<br>Fix little potholes before they wreck relationships


<br>Values and integrity

<br>Let these guide your actions and your difficult conversations


<br>Perception checking

 <br><br>
<br>An opportunity for an employer to assess you and your skills against their requirements for the job and the company.
<br>For you to assess if this is where you want to work – the type of work and the company.<br>
Preparing
<br>3R’s:  Research, Research, Research

<br>Check out the firm website.
<br>Use practical training as an opportunity to assess a firm.
<br>Talk to someone who works there: firm owner, supervisor, court reporter


<br>Caution – if you phone or Zoom:

<br>Make sure person has time to spend.
<br>Ask specific questions – be prepared.
<br>Don’t try to sell yourself.


<br>Prepare your own “interview” questions
<br>Prepare responses to questions

<br>Don’t have “canned” or textbook answers


<br>3 P’s: practice, practice, practice
<br>Obtain feedback
<br>Think about how you will dress, present yourself and be remembered<br>
Interview Types
<br>Depends on level of position and size of organization)
<br>
<br>One-on-one (firm owner / supervisor)
<br>Panel (firm owner, supervisor, and/or court reporter)
<br>One or two-stage<br>
- Could start with a panel and move to one-on-one.<br>
Sparkle and Shine The First 30 Seconds
<br>
<br>“The first 30 seconds of a job interview are crucial.” – Ollie Stevenson
<br>Based on experiences of real-life people.
<br>“The interviewer makes an immediate overall judgment about you within the first five seconds, and the next 25 seconds are spent checking the chemistry and verifying the initial impression.”
<br>Decisions often made in the first few minutes.<br>
First Impressions
<br>Handling nervousness: breathing exercise, visualization, and positive self-talk
<br>Arrive 10 minutes early
<br>Make an impression on everybody, including the receptionist and other staff<br>
How to Handle Early Moments
<br>Project the image that fits the job you are going after.
<br>Make eye contact, smile, and trust your gut reactions.
<br>Introduce yourself in a courteous manner.
<br>Have a firm handshake. (COVID warning)
<br>Not too eager; not too nervous.
<br>Just be yourself.
<br>Remember:  People prefer to do business with those they like.
<br>Dance their dance. If they sit, you sit.  If they joke, you smile.
<br>The more research you’ve done on the company before the interview will help your “chemistry” with the Interview.
<br>Within five minutes the interviewers can tell how the interview will go.<br>
Answering Employer's Questions
<br>Make eye contact
<br>Use S.T.A.R. method (Situation, Task, Activities, Result)
<br>Be positive and professional – i.e. do not criticize former employers or staff
<br>DO NOT LIE OR EXAGERRATE<br>
- Body language will generally give you away<br>
Verbal Communication
<br>Speak clearly so that the interviewer can easily hear you.
<br>Use good grammar and appropriate vocabulary and avoid slang.

<br>Eg. Yeah, you guys, like, you know, whatever, hey, et cetera.


<br>Practice changing bad habits (self-awareness).
<br>Professional tone.
<br>Sound positive – don’t use words like “think” or “guess.”<br>
Non-Verbal Communication
<br>90 percent of what we say comes from body language; 10 percent from what we say.
<br>Positive and relaxed body language
<br>Good posture
<br>Good eye contact, include everyone present
<br>Smile
<br>Open posture; placement of hands
<br>Use natural hand movements; not distracting.
<br>Avoid fidgeting or distracting mannerisms.<br>
Listening and Responding Skills
<br>Listen to the question and do not interrupt.
<br>Ask the interviewer for clarification if needed.
<br>Think about your answer.  You do not have to answer immediately after a question is asked.  Take your time.
<br>Answer the question briefly, but with enough information to fully answer the question.
<br>Use a conversational tone.<br>
Unassertive words (hesitant, fills interview with doubts):
<br>
<br>I’ll think about it.
<br>I’ll try.
<br>Maybe
<br>I’m not sure.
<br>Yes, but
<br>I don’t know.<br>
Aggressive words (overbearing):
<br>That was a stupid question.
<br>Who do you think you are?
<br>Well, have I got the job or not?
<br>No sweat.<br>
Disclaimers:
<br>I’m sorry, but…
<br>You may not believe this but…
<br>This may seem silly but…
<br>Would you mind very much if…<br>
Assertive words (confident):
<br>I will or I won’t
<br>I can or I can’t
<br>Yes, no, or I prefer
<br>I would like to find out (indicates your willingness)
<br>I assure you that won’t happen<br>
Show Enthusiasm
<br>
<br>Do you look like someone who really wants this job?
<br>Convince yourself before convincing an interviewer!
<br>It may be the difference that lands you the job.
<br>If lacking, it is time for reflection and soul-searching.<br>
Supporting Information and Interview-Ending Behaviour
<br>Have questions prepared when asked if you have any questions.
<br>Extra copies of resume and application letter.
<br>List of references and contact information.
<br>Say “thank you” for the interview.
<br>Appropriate ending statement depending on next steps.

 <br><br>
<br>If the reporter's relationship with the firm is that of a subcontractor, the reporter must pay their income tax quarterly to CRA
<br>When reporters receive income from work, a percentage of that income needs to be set aside for tax purposes, including paying CPP (recommendation: 30%)
<br>Taz laws change every year - to make sure reporters are taking advantage of all the tax deductions to them and to avoid the potential of a possible audit, they may want to seek professional help
<br>Tax calculator: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://simpletax.ca/calculator?&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxbObrYTA5wIVj8VkCh3wUgo5EAAYAyABEgLZ_fD_BwE" target="_blank">https://simpletax.ca/calculator?&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxbObrYTA5wIVj8VkCh3wUgo5EAAYAyABEgLZ_fD_BwE</a>
<br>Tax deduction: reduces the amount of income that's subject to tax (e.g., operational court reporting expenses, RRSPs)
<br>Tax credit: reduces the amount of tax owing

<br>An amount eligible for a tax credit generally creates a federal tax savings based on the lowest tax bracket, 15%
<br>A 10,000 tax credit amount will generate $1,500 actual tax credit against taxes owing, which means your tax bill is lower by $1,500 (10,000 x 15%)
<br>The calculation is the same no matter the tax bracket (e.g., tuition expenses, donations, student loan interest, medical expenses, Canada child benefit, child care deduction, age)


<br>Marginal tax rate: the amount of tax paid on any additional dollar made up to the next tax bracket
<br>Average tax rate: percentage of tax paid based on your total taxable income and reflects the total tax you are paying<br>
Tax Deductions
<br>the reporter doesn't have to claim the deduction in the year they purchased the item
<br>some of the deductions reporters generally are allowed include:

<br>Anything purchased to help reporters perform their job, including shorthand machine, computer hardware and software. Some items are depreciated over time (shorthand machine) and some can be written off 100% at the time of purchase (software). 
<br>Depending on the working arrangement with the firm, car expenses including gas and maintenance. A log needs to be kept of business versus personal travel including date, destination, purpose, and number of kilometres driven (see example).
<br>Full cost of some utility expenses, including home Internet and phone expenses if used for the job.
<br>Partial cost of other utility expenses, including power and heat. Based on a percentage of office space with the rest of the house (see example).
<br>Any items purchased to create a home office.


<br>Note: Generally, items 3, 4, and 5 can only be claimed if an office is not provided for you at the place you work.<br>
How to Claim Care Expenses
<br>Example

<br>On January 1 the odometer on your vehicle says 10,000 kms.
<br>On December 31 the odometer on your vehicle says 30,000 kms.
<br>By keeping a log, you determine 5,000 kms. were business related.
<br>From this example, you are able to write off 25% of your vehicle expenses. 5,000/20,000=25%
<br>Note: There are different rules for a purchased vehicle.


<br>Write-Offa Include:<br>
- Leasing<br>
- Gas<br>
- Servicing and Repairs<br>
- Insurance<br>
- Parts<br>
- Licence and Registration fees<br>
- Car Washes<br>
- Note: Parking is a 100% write-off if done for business purposes.<br>
How to Claim Home Expenses
<br>Layout Particulars<br>
- Apartment is 1,000 square feet<br>
- Office is 100 square feet (10 x10)<br>
- 100/1,000 means you can write off 10% of the following items:<br>
- Rent (get advice)<br>
- Gas and electricity<br>
- Water<br>
- General home repairs not particular to a given room.<br>
- You can still write of 100% of the following items:<br>
- Internet<br>
- Cell phone<br>
- Items and repairs for your office only (some of these may be depreciated)<br>
Tax rates
<br>based on taxable income<br>
Canada Tax Brackets for 2023
<br><br>Alberta Tax Brackets for 2023<br><br>Tax Rate Example<br>
<br>Assumption: Reporter had taxable income of $70,000 working in Alberta.<br>
- Federal tax: $7,798<br>
- Provincial tax: $4,149<br>
- CPP Deduction: $7,509<br>
- Total tax to be paid: $19,455<br>
- Net Pay: $50,545<br>
- Average Tax Rate: 18.21%<br>
- Marginal Tax Rate: 30.5%<br>
Employment Insurance Benefits for the Self-Employed
<br>Optional benefit a self-employed person can pay for through a tax deduction.
<br>Benefit: Financial support of up to 55% of earnings to maximum of $650 per week (2023).
<br>Types of benefits: maternity, parental, sickness, family caregiver for children, compassionate care.
<br>Conditions:

<br>Be registered in self-employed program for at least 12 months
<br>Decreased the amount of time you spend on your business by more than 40% for at least one week.
<br>Have earned a minimum amount of net self-employed earnings between January 1 and December 31 of the year before you apply for benefits.


<br>How to register:

<br>Register online for the program through My Service Canada Account (MSCA)
<br>Pay EI premiums


<br>You can apply for special benefits 12 months after your confirmed registration date.
<br>Estimate of Premiums

<br>For 2023, you will pay $1.63 in EI premiums for every $100 earned to a maximum of $1,002.45. (Rate changes annually)
<br>Same rate as an employee would pay.


<br>NOTE:  “Once you receive benefits as a self-employed person, you’ll continue paying premiums for as long as you’re self-employed.”<br>
Expense Accounts
<br>Arrangements are usually made for reporters to be reimbursed when they have to travel out of town. If the reporter is paying for the expenses out their own pocket (to be reimbursed later), it is best to pay with a credit card. If the reporter happens to lose their receipt, then they will still have a record of the transaction.
<br>When reporters do out-of-town work and receive money for meals and/or mileage (e.g., $50 per day for meals and 50 cents a kilometer), they do not have to claim that money as income on their income tax returns.
<br>If a reporter does receive money for mileage, they cannot claim that trip as a taxable vehicle expense on their income tax return.<br>
GST - Goods and Services Tax
<br>When Must GST Registration Take Place?

<br>You have 29 days to apply for GST registration from the day that your business exceeds the small supplier threshold amount.
<br>If on June 1 your revenues go over $30,000, you have until June 29 to apply for registration. 
<br>Note: June 1 would be my effective GST registration date, and I will be responsible for collecting GST/HST from that date.


<br>How to register for the GST

<br>GST registration with the CRA is fairly easy. You can register by phone, online, by mail or drop into your local CRA office. What's the GST Registration Process provides the phone numbers and addresses you need.
<br>When you've registered, you'll be assigned a business number. This is a business identification number that you'll use for all your dealings with the CRA.

<br>If you choose to purchase used professional software, you will need to complete a transfer agreement
<br><br>The software we use in the program doesn't need any special requirements for a laptop. The minimum requirements recommended by Stenograph are included below. However, most laptops on sale now will meet or exceed them.<br>Some advice as you begin your search:<br>
<br>Set a budget and buy the most RAM and hard drive space available within your budget.
<br>A solid-state drive (SSD) is recommended over an HDD, but either one will suit your needs.
<br>Consider the weight of the laptop as you will be carrying is around when you start working. You can purchase an external monitor and wireless keyboard/mouse for use at home to increase your workspace.
<br>Keyboard and touchpad - try it before you buy it! Type on it and see how it feels, if it's noisy, and whether your finger can easily reach the enter key. Some keyboards have the enter key a little farther away which makes it harder to reach.
<br>A minimum of three UDB ports. If the laptop you like has less than three, you may want to purchase a USB hub. The ports are needed to hook up various devices to your computer.

<br>LAN / Local Area Network

<br>A computer network limited to a small area which makes it easy for users to share info


<br>Router

<br>Device that allows multiple computers to join the same network
<br>Early versions had Ethernet ports for wired connections
<br>Modern versions offer wireless connectivity
<br>Connecting to a router provides access to a LAN, it does not necessarily provide access to the Internet

<br>The router must be connected to a modem to connect to the Internet




<br>Modem

<br>Device that provides access to the Internet

<br>By connecting the modem to the router (instead of directly to a computer), all devices connected to the router can access the modem and, therefore, the Internet

 <br><br><br><br>
<br>Arrive 30 minutes before the proceeding is set to commence (45-60 minutes if it's videotaped or realtime)
<br>Introduce yourself when you enter the law office
<br>Set up at one end of the table in the discovery room

<br>Preferably away from the door
<br>Consider where the electrical outlets and coffee stations are located


<br>Introduce yourself and hand out business cards to lawyers
<br><br>
<br>Set up your equipment first

<br>Make sure everything is working properly


<br>Request a style of cause

<br>The examining lawyer will have the style of cause

<br>Ask for a copy of it or ask if you can take a picture of it


<br>It must be written exactly the same way as it's given to you, including capitalization and/or spelling errors
<br>If time permits, quickly scan the style of cause for spellings and to learn about the case you're about to write


<br><br>
<br>
When working with unfamiliar counsel, ask for their name and who they represent

<br>
Examples:

<br>
Unfamiliar Counsel<br>
Court Reporter: Sir, may I have your name, please.<br>
Lawyer: John R. Jones<br>
Court Reporter: And whom do you represent?<br>
Lawyer: I am on for the plaintiff.
Familiar Counsel<br>
Court Reporter: Mr. Jones, who are you representing today?<br>
Lawyer: I am on for the plaintiff, Martin Wilson.



<br>
Always ask for the witness's full name<br>
*Would you please state your name.<br>
Could you tell me your full name, please.

<br>
If the witness's name is on the style of cause, you may confirm the spelling.<br>
Is this the correct spelling of your name?

<br>
If the witness's name is not on the style of cause, ask them to spell their name.

<br>
If the witness's name is different on the style of cause, confirm the correct spelling.

<br>Information Sheet<br>
<br>Keep track of names, spellings, and times of the examination in a notebook or an information sheet.
<br>Some firms will provide you with a template. Billing from expected start time in brackets, not actual start time. Good place to track exhibit numbers.<br>

Martin John Wilson<br>
Examined by Counsel Jones
<br>Setup<br>
<br>Make dictionary entries, speaker IDs, and get yourself ready to write.
<br>Do whatever it takes to feel comfortable before the proceeding starts.
<br>Administering the oath<br>
<br>Administer an oath to the witness prior to examination commencing.
<br>Ask if the witness would like to swear on the Bible or take an affirmation. Counsel will help you to explain if the witness doesn't understand the difference (promise to tell the truth vs. swearing to tell the truth on a Bible)
<br>Make eye contact with the witness while administering the oath.
<br>State the oath in a firm and steady voice.
<br>Oath with a Bible:<br>
Do you solemnly swear the evidence you are about the give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?
<br>Affirmation:<br>
Do you solemnly affirm the evidence you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
<br>People with religious beliefs other than Christian may choose to make an affirmation
<br>People with no religious beliefs may choose to make an affirmation
<br>With an interpreter:<br>
First administer the oath to the interpreter:<br>
Do you solemnly swear to well and truly interpret from the English language to the  language and from the  language to the English language to the best of your skill and ability so help you God?<br>
Do you solemnly affirm to well and truly interpret from the English language to the  language and from the  language to the English language to the best of your skill and ability so help you God?<br>
Then administer the oath to the witness through the interpreter.
<br>Example SOC<br><br>
<br>Main role during the proceeding is to write it verbatim, but other tasks include:

<br>Dealing with discussions off the record
<br>Reporter readbacks
<br>Anticipating counsel interjections
<br>Interrupting speakers
<br>Marking exhibits
<br>Obtaining proper spellings
<br>Indicating non-verbal actions
<br>Handling heated arguments, asides, and conversation by third parties
<br>Handling adjournments


<br>Marking Exhibits<br>
<br>At pretrial proceedings, exhibits are marked by the reporter by affixing an exhibit stamp.&nbsp; The exhibit stamp should be red in color and should be filled out by the reporter with a blue pen.&nbsp;This is to clearly distinguish a document marked as an exhibit from any copies that may later be made.

<br>You may use pre-made stickers instead of stamps if they fit on the document being marked


<br>To facilitate quick reference by counsel, placement of the exhibit stamp should be the top right corner of any document.&nbsp;If the top right corner is not available, place the stamp as close to the top of the document as possible.&nbsp;If there is no place on the entire face of the document to put the exhibit stamp, place the stamp on the back of the document.

<br>It is prudent practice to let counsel know that you are putting the exhibit stamp on the back of the document.


<br>Make sure when you are placing the stamp, that the stamp does not touch any written portion of the document.
<br>When marking photographs, have prepared exhibit stamp stickers to place on the back of the photograph.&nbsp;The ink smudges when you stamp the back of photographs (with the shiny finish).&nbsp; Stickers are often used for documents as well.
<br>The reporter would include the following information in the exhibit stamp:<br>
<br>Sequential number (or letter if marked for identification)
<br>Full name of witness (same as given when sworn in, all caps)
<br>Date of examination
<br>Reporter’s name and initials
<br>Full exhibits receive a number designation ("D" for discovery):<br>
“Pasted image 20240718000440.png” could not be found.<br>Exhibits for identification receive a letter designation:<br>“Pasted image 20240718000549.png” could not be found.<br>
OR<br>
“Pasted image 20240718000559.png” could not be found.<br>Exhibits marked in a cross-examination on Affidavit do not have the letter "D":<br>
“Pasted image 20240718000626.png” could not be found.<br>Discussions off the Record<br>
<br>The reporter goes off the record only when both sides agree to go off the record

<br>If opposing counsel gives no response or any type of indication to the requesting counsel wanting to go off the record, the reporter can assume opposing counsel is fine with going off the record.


<br>The reporter should make it obvious that he or she is not writing anything that is being said.&nbsp; Make an attempt to be obvious that you are off the record.
<br>When counsel make the request to go off the record, it is recorded in the transcript unless the lawyer talks directly to the reporter only to go off the record; however, when the request is made to go back on the record, that is not included in the transcript.
<br>When counsel are discussing whether or not to go off the record, that is included in the transcript.
<br>Interrupting Speakers<br>
<br>Unlike clarifying the spelling of a word, you must make the interruption immediately to clarify something not heard or understood. If you hesitate, the speakers move on, and it is difficult to capture the moment again.
<br>Say something short and to the point (“pardon me”) while making eye contact with the speaker.&nbsp;
<br>If you are clarifying a word that you think is the response but are not satisfied, repeat the response to the speaker.&nbsp; For example: Did you say “yes”? If you didn’t hear an answer, don’t expect your audio to pick up the sound.
<br>If you are unsure whether you heard a name or word correctly and can put that word into context later, make a notation and clarify the word during a break.&nbsp;If it's a proper name, you will have to get the spelling anyway.
<br>Witnesses with accents can be difficult to understand, so be sure to advise examining counsel you are experiencing this difficulty.&nbsp; Lawyers can then change the way they ask questions and will understand if you are interrupting often.
<br>To clarify the spelling of a word, make a notation in your transcript.&nbsp;"Oops" is a good Case CAT feature for this!&nbsp;You can then ask your questions at the next break. A good resource for the spelling of proper nouns is from the documents themselves.&nbsp;Otherwise, you will direct your question to the witness or counsel to get a spelling.&nbsp;Record the information directly into your transcript or on your information page.&nbsp;
<br>The internet is a great resource for researching names of geographic areas, company names, street names, etc.&nbsp;
<br>It should be the goal of the reporter to clarify any information needed before they leave the discovery room. It will save time when editing.
<br>You can try to tell a witness to slow down, but it often doesn't work. Do not interrupt if the lawyer is going for the "kill," the witness is reacting to the questions and not thinking, don't spoil the lawyer's train of thought or give the witness time to think.
<br>Interjections<br>
<br>One of the biggest adjustments NAIT graduates have when they start out in industry is writing interjections by the witness's lawyer. One way to best deal with this scenario is to anticipate when an interjection or objection will be made.
<br>Here is a list of possible reasons for an interjection or objection from opposing counsel:<br>
<br>Hypothetical questions.&nbsp;Examining counsel are not allowed to ask hypothetical questions, e.g., "If you weren't speeding, do you think the accident would have happened?"
<br>Questions that ask for an opinion.&nbsp;Examining counsel are not allowed to ask for an opinion from the witness unless the witness is called as an expert in a specific field, e.g., "Do you think Mr. Jones did a good job in his position as manager?" gray area when it's about the witness's frame of mind
<br>Questions that do not relate to the pleadings in a questioning for discovery or questions that do not fall within the “four corners” of an affidavit in a cross-examination on affidavit, e.g., if we  had a car accident, and the witness was not claiming future loss of income because they got over their injuries after a certain amount of time, examining counsel cannot ask questions about their future employment and potential income
<br>When examining counsel asks for an undertaking - lawyer will usually step in and answer for the witness
<br>When the questioning becomes heated between the counsel and the witness, the witness’s lawyer may interject to protect his or her witness, i.e., they will make an objection just to stop the proceeding and give their witness's a chance to compose themselves again and think about their answers
<br>The body language of the witness’s lawyer.&nbsp;Many times the witness’s lawyer will put his hand in front of witness or move up to the end of his chair so the witness knows not to answer the question and the lawyer can interject.
<br>Note: In Canadian proceedings, witnesses do not answer questions that are objected to.&nbsp;You may see the witness answering in the demo videos from NCRA Career Launcher.<br>Readbacks<br>
<br>Reporter readbacks must be performed proficiently upon request.&nbsp;Many times the competency of the reporter is judged by their ability to read back.
<br>When asked to read back, take your time.&nbsp;Review your text or vertical notes prior to beginning the readback.
<br>The readback should be in a loud, clear voice at a steady pace (approximately 140 wpm). You must give the speaker identification first, e.g., "Question: Where were you on the night in question? Answer: I was - Speaker: Ms. Smith: Don't answer that."
<br>Readbacks should be read with back-up equipment on. If the readback is not the last question or answer, highlight or mark the spot that was read back, and copy and paste in the appropriate spot.
<br>Sometimes the readback requested is not only the last question asked or answer given but is not specific. If necessary, ask clarifying questions to determine what is being requested to be read.
<br>If you need a few minutes to find the portion to read back or would like to review it with the audio backup, ask for a brief adjournment.
<br>Obtaining Spellings<br>
<br>To clarify the spelling of a word, make a notation in your steno notes or make a note on your information page. You can then get the spelling at the next break.
<br>The best place to get spellings is from the documents themselves. Otherwise, depending on the spelling needed, you will have to ask the witness or possibly counsel to get a spelling. Once you receive the spelling, record the spelling directly into your transcript and/or in the top right-hand corner on the back of your information page. Some spellings, like geography and company names, can also be attained from the Internet.
<br>In terms of spellings, it should be the goal of the reporter to attain all necessary spellings before he/she leaves the questioning room. As the reporter, you don't want to waste time when producing the transcript having to look things up.
<br>Indicating Non-Verbal Actions<br>
<br>When a witness nods his head to indicate “yes” or shakes his head to indicate “no”, counsel may ask for a verbal response.&nbsp; If they do not, you may indicate to counsel there was no verbal response.
<br>If a witness uses a body motion to answer a question, counsel may describe the motion on the record or ask the witness to describe it.<br>
Q Where did you hit your head?&nbsp; (Witness points to his head)&nbsp; &nbsp;(New Paragraph)<br>
I notice you are indicating the left temple area; is that correct?<br>
A Correct.&nbsp;
<br>If the lawyer doesn't do this, the reporter should interrupt and indicate there was no verbal response on the record.
<br>We do not describe non-verbal actions in the record. There's no way to verify and it can be left to interpretation.
<br>Heated Arguments<br>
<br>If there is a heated argument between counsel and the witness, do not interrupt and do the best you can.
<br>If the heated argument is between counsel and their speech is overlapping, immediately step in and remind them to speak one at a time.
<br>Conversation by Third Parties<br>
<br>If an observer/layperson speaks during a questioning and is not at the time under oath, immediately interject and ask whether the comments are to be included in the record.
<br>If the comments are included in the record, the speaker is identified in colloquy format, e.g., MR. BROWN:
<br>Handling Adjournments<br>
<br>Similar to discussions off the record, all counsel must agree to adjourn.
<br>Like discussions off the record, the reporter quits writing when both sides agree to adjourn.
<br>Apply Professional Conduct During Proceedings<br>
<br>You should provide professional conduct from the time you leave your home until you get back. How you act and present yourself during discussions off the record, adjournments, and in setting up and dismantling your equipment is just as important as when you write the proceeding.
<br><br>
<br>Ask counsel if they would like to order a transcript
<br>Check for delivery deadlines

<br>Regular (5-10 business days)
<br>Expedited (3-5 business days)
<br>Next day


<br>Counsel may sometimes put a transcript order on hold. This means they don't want it produced right away but may order a copy in the future.

<br>Questionings in Aid


<br>Upload backup digital files to your computer
<br>Have all files named and properly organized
<br>Obtain spellings from counsel or witness that you likely won't be able to find yourself
<br>Be personable and polite
<br>Prepare the Transcript<br>
<br>Write

<br>Goal is to get everything down and as accurate as possible. In essence, write like you have no back-up audio.
<br>Ask counsel or the witness for spellings you won't be able to easily find.


<br>Edit with audio

<br>Edit the transcript applying the rules of proper grammar and punctuation
<br>Mark spots where further research may be needed


<br>Proofread with audio

<br>Proofread carefully with the audio


<br>Proofread without audio

<br>Read for context
<br>You don't know what you don't know! Check everything!


<br>Proofreading Tips for New Reporters<br>
<br>New reporters may find proofreading on paper is more effective
<br>Always proofread for context first; ensure the punctuation portrays the correct meaning
<br>Read one word at a time; spelling errors and misused words are common errors
<br>Check the page for proper formatting and speaker tokens
<br>If your mentor is proofreading your transcripts, keep a log of common errors. You don't want to submit transcripts the with same errors

 <br><br>
<br>Questioning transcripts are witness-based, i.e., each witness's transcript is a discrete document.

<br>E.g., if you take the questioning of 3 witnesses in one day, each witness's transcript will begin with page 1, exhibit 1, and undertaking 1


<br>Court trials/quasi-judicial trials are case-based, i.e., proceedings are continuous and don't start over for each individual witness

<br>Transcript page numbers &amp; exhibit numbers carry on throughout the whole proceeding


<br>Generally speaking, an examining lawyer only gets one chance to examine a witness from the other side during the questioning for discovery stage.  However, sometimes a witness is examined at a discovery, and the examining lawyer will not finish his or her questioning or will have finished questioning subject to the undertakings that were given or new documents that may be produced into evidence before trial.  When the lawyer comes back to question the witness a second time on a different date, this is called a continuation.
<br>Why might a questioning be continued?

<br>adjourned (to a specified date) or adjourned sine die (to a date in the future)
<br>adjourned subject to the undertakings (very specific adjournment where further questioning may only apply to the undertakings)
<br>reopen a concluded questioning (because new documents were filed or new information has come to light)


<br>At the time the booking is made, the reporting firm will generally ask if it is a continuation so the reporter knows before they attend the discovery.
<br>How else might a reporter know it's a continuation?

<br>Multiday bookings
<br>Firm may advise the proceedings are continued
<br>Counsel may advise the proceedings are continued
<br>Reporter may inquire whether the proceedings are continued


<br>When a reporter is reporting a continuation of a questioning for discovery, they will request the last page number, the last exhibit number, and the last undertaking number from the previous examination.

<br>Paragraph numbers are not applied in Alberta transcripts, but you may encounter them in other jurisdictions (also witness-based and continued on further questioning dates)


<br>The cover page will then read "Continued Questioning for Discovery of ^Witness's Name^"
<br>The reporter at a continuation may ask examining counsel if they would like the witness resworn.&nbsp; The sworn notation may then read:<br>
^WITNESS'S NAME^, Sworn, Questioned by ^Lawyer's Name^<br>
^WITNESS'S NAME^, Previously Sworn, Questioned by ^Lawyer's Name^

 <br><br>You may find an American lawsuit where one of the witnesses lives in Canada and, as a result, they conduct the deposition here.<br>Formatting and Title Page<br>
<br>Most firms in Canada will use their regular discovery format.
<br>The style of cause is different in American depositions and will be transposed on the title page in a similar format as that given to them. The rest of the title page will remain the same.
<br>Major Differences Between Questionings and Depositions<br>
<br>In most cases, the transcript is first sent to the witness with a covering letter.
<br>The witness can make any changes to the transcripts it wants to. To do this, the witness will fill out an errata sheet attached to the back of the transcript. The errata sheet will contain (1) the page and line number of each change, (2) the actual change itself, (3) the reason for the change, (4) signature by witness certifying that the deposition is correct as stated with the exceptions noted above, and (5) the date that the errata sheet was filled out.
<br>In administering the oath, the witness raises his right hand, no Bible, no standing. The witness is sworn, not affirmed.
<br>Exhibits marked in the deposition are attached to the back of the transcript and become part of the actual transcript.
<br>The certificate filled out by the reporter is much more in depth.
<br>Having a videographer present in a deposition is much more common that in questionings in Canada.
<br>In most depositions if the witness's counsel makes an objection to a question, the witness still answers the question after the objection has been made. In Canada, the witness will not answer and the examining lawyer will have to go to Chambers and receive a ruling in his favor to get the witness to answer.
<br>American lawyers, when they conduct a deposition in Canada, almost always pay in American dollars.

 <br><br>Virtual proceedings are secure, economic, and just as effective as in-person proceedings.<br>
<br>Accounts needed/must be familiar with the following:

<br>Zoom
<br>WebEx
<br>Microsoft Teams
<br>Adobe Connect


<br>Either the firm or the individual court reporter will invite participants
<br>Preparation<br>
<br>Start time (arrive 30 minutes before start time)
<br>Introduce yourself to each person and confirm their identity/their role
<br>Troubleshooting? Some people may require guidance (mute/unmute button, video on/off button)
<br>Introductory statements - set the tone! Explain your role and what participants can do if things go wrong during the examination. Some good tips to provide include:

<br>Speak one at a time
<br>Wait for the speaker to finish before they begin
<br>Make audible answers


<br>Obtain the information you need (style of cause, determine the appearance, whether or not the questioning is a continuation, and the full name of the witness)
<br>Administer oath
<br>Press record! If recording directly to Zoom/platform is use, ask permission from all of the people attending the meeting
<br>Audio Issues<br>
<br>Identify and address audio issues right away by speaking to each participant in the meeting
<br>To mute or not to mute? Easier to interrupt if unmuted, depends on background noise, good idea to connect foot pedal to mute/unmute
<br>Connections (may be difficult to hear if a participant doesn't have good internet connection)

<br>Hardwired! connect directly to your router during proceedings - Wi-Fi is not a stable enough environment to avoid connection issues
<br>Phone - have a participant phone into a meeting if there are audio issues


<br>Interrupt when you don't hear parts of a lawyer's question or a witness's answer!
<br>Headphones - direct participants to use headphones if there's an echo
<br>Exhibits<br>
<br>Some counsel may send these in advance and some after the proceedings
<br>Use stamps feature in Adobe to mark exhibits
<br>When counsel marks an exhibit, make a statement on the record, e.g., "That would be Exhibit D-5." Include the statement on the record and make the notation in your transcript.
<br>Add Stamp shortcut: Tools menu &gt; Share &amp; Review &gt; Stamp &gt; Add stamp tool to shortcuts<br>
Create custom stamp: Stamp tool on toolbar in open document &gt; Custom Stamps &gt; Create &gt; Browse to Download folder and choose exhibit stamp image &gt; Create new category for stamp ("Questionings") and Name ("Exhibit") &gt; Uncheck down sample stamp to reduce file size &gt; OK<br>
Add stamp to document: Stamp &gt; Category, Name &gt; Click to place stamp on document &gt; Fill &amp; Sign in toolbar &gt; fill in exhibit information on the stamp &gt; File &gt; Save marked exhibit as "Exhibit D-1 - Witness's Name"<br>Breaks<br>
<br>Mute participants
<br>Turn off video
<br>Make note of the expected time of return and turn on video to indicate at that time that you are ready
<br>Display a picture or a document during a break indicating that the proceedings are on pause by using the share screen function
<br>Conclusion<br>
<br>Follow the same steps as in-person proceedings

<br>Confirm orders
<br>Check for spellings
<br>End the meeting for all participants

<br>If counsel requests to stay in the meeting with their client, assign them the host and leave the meeting




<br>Use (Indiscernible) very sparingly if it wasn't heard and it was impossible to interrupt<br>]]></description><link>http://stenotab.tips/6-the-business/18-proceedings.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6 The Business/18 Proceedings.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tabea Adam]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 02:01:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Certificate of Non-Appearance (CNA)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>If the witness doe snot appear at the time and place as indicated on the notice of examination/questioning, a Certificate of Non-Appearance is issued.
<br>The certificate is normally prepared by counsel and the court reporter and then may be filed with the court by counsel.
<br>30 minutes is the generally accepted period to wait for a witness to attend.\
<br>Counsel may make a statement on the record.
<br>The court reporter bills a minimum attendance fee.

 <br><br><br>Characteristics:<br>
<br>Impartiality: The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) or panel must act impartially and without bias.
<br>Due Process: Parties are entitled to due process, including the right to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and receive a fair hearing.
<br>Record-Keeping: A detailed record of the proceedings is maintained for transparency and review purposes.
<br>Expertise: The decision-makers are often experts in the relevant field, allowing for informed and specialized judgments.
<br>Quasi-judicial hearings blend elements of formal judicial procedures with the practicalities and expertise of administrative bodies, ensuring that disputes and regulatory matters are resolved fairly and efficiently within their specific contexts.<br><br>The quasi-judicial hearing process involves administrative agencies or bodies that perform functions similar to those of a court, but within the context of their specific areas of expertise. These hearings are often related to regulatory, administrative, or disciplinary actions. Here is an overview of the quasi-judicial hearing process:<br>
<br>Complaint/Petition: The process begins with the filing of a complaint, petition, or application by an individual, organization, or government entity. This initiates the case and sets the procedural wheels in motion.
<br>Notice of Hearing: The parties involved are notified about the hearing. This notice includes the date, time, place, and nature of the hearing, ensuring that all parties have adequate time to prepare.
<br><br>
<br>Preliminary Conference: Sometimes, a preliminary conference is held to clarify issues, set timelines, and discuss procedural matters.
<br>Discovery: Similar to judicial proceedings, parties may engage in discovery to gather evidence and information from each other.
<br><br>
<br>Administrative Law Judge (ALJ): The hearing is typically presided over by an Administrative Law Judge or a panel. The ALJ or panel acts as an impartial arbiter.
<br>Opening Statements: Both parties may present opening statements to outline their positions and the evidence they intend to present.
<br>Presentation of Evidence: Evidence is presented by both sides. This includes witness testimonies, documents, and other relevant materials. Witnesses may be cross-examined by the opposing party.
<br>Rules of Evidence: While formal rules of evidence may be relaxed compared to judicial proceedings, the ALJ ensures that evidence presented is relevant and reliable.
<br>Record of Proceedings: The entire hearing is typically recorded and transcribed to ensure there is an accurate record for review.
<br><br>
<br>Briefs and Arguments: Parties may be allowed to submit post-hearing briefs or written arguments summarizing their positions and the evidence presented.
<br>Deliberation and Decision: The ALJ or panel reviews the evidence and arguments, deliberates, and makes a decision based on the merits of the case.
<br>Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law: The decision includes findings of fact and conclusions of law, detailing the reasoning behind the decision.
<br>Issuance of Decision: The decision is issued in writing and provided to all parties involved. This document outlines the outcome and any orders or sanctions imposed.
<br><br>
<br>Internal Appeals: There may be an internal appeals process within the agency or body, where the decision can be reviewed by a higher authority within the same organization.
<br>Judicial Review: Parties dissatisfied with the decision may seek judicial review in a court of law. The court reviews the administrative record and determines whether the quasi-judicial body acted within its authority and followed proper procedures.
<br><br>
<br>Implementation of Decision: The decision is enforced as per the agency's or body's rules. This may involve sanctions, penalties, or other actions as prescribed in the decision.
<br>Compliance Monitoring: The agency may monitor compliance with the decision and take further action if necessary.

 <br><br>Welcome!
StenoTab is a compilation of all my notes from NAIT's Captioning and Court Reporting program. I created this site for 3 reasons:
1. I strongly believe that knowledge should be free and accessible to everyone
2. I want to help foster a community where the success of one is the success of all
3. I hope to inspire people to explore the field, whether as a potential career or to appreciate its important role in the legal system and our lives, in general<br><br>Stenography
1: the art or process of writing in shorthand<br>
2: shorthand especially written from dictation or oral discourse<br>
3: the making of shorthand notes and subsequent transcription of them
Merriam-Webster.com
<br>Captioners and court reporters are professionals who can type at speeds of 225 words per minute or more with at least 95% accuracy using a steno machine. We turn spoken words into written text using our machine and computer technology.<br>Being a captioner or court reporter is a unique and exciting career. Every day is different, and you get to learn new and interesting things all the time. Plus, it has the potential to be quite lucrative. Career opportunities include:<br>
<br>Broadcast Captioner (live television events and internet programs)
<br>CART Provider (real-time transcription in educational, corporate, or community settings)
<br>Court Reporter (court trials, examinations for discovery, and hearings)
<br>But there’s a lot to learn beyond just typing well!<br><br>Are we being replaced by AI?
Short answer: No.
Long answer:
I don't believe it will be possible to replace court reporters with AI, and this belief stems from two main factors: human cognition and accountability.
Human cognition is essential to what we do. Court reporters manage fast speech, accents, crosstalk, mumbling, and background noise in real-time and can ask for clarification on ambiguous terms. We can interrupt the proceedings to ascertain what the speaker said if we missed it. "Fifteen" can sound like "fifty," just as "B" can sound like "V." Plus, homophones exist – for example, did the speaker say "write" or "right"? Context plays a vital role too. Did the officer say "No. Shots were fired," or did he say "No shots were fired"? A court reporter can hear the distinction; AI can't. And what error rate would you or your client be okay with? 10%? 20%? Hiring a certified court reporter guarantees a near perfect transcript. Additionally, AI datasets have shown significant racial biases.
Court reporters ensure the accuracy of the record as impartial third parties. We certify transcripts and are legally responsible for errors. In other words, we display unbiased accountability. Who would be accountable if AI takes down the record incorrectly? The party providing the AI, the company that owns it, or the legal system? Many US courtrooms have already banned AI entirely, and I believe this issue was a major factor in those decisions. The other concern is privacy. One of the 12 major risks to the use of AI is insecurity. There have been multiple occasions when faulty data storage practices resulted in leaked personal data. AI simply cannot be incorporated into a legal setting in its current state.
Plus, if AI has advanced to the point of replacing humans, I think it’s safe to say that we won’t be the only profession affected.
<br>What is digital reporting?
A digital reporter operates an audio recording device to capture what happens during a proceeding. The make minimal "tag notes" to identify speakers and highlight key moments, but their only record is the audio file itself. They don't take down a complete word-for-word account of everything said and  don't use stenography. If the equipment fails due to technical issues or user error, there's no backup. This could seriously harm a case.
Once the recording is made, the digital reporter’s job is essentially done. They aren’t responsible for creating the final transcript. Instead, the audio is broken up into smaller clips and sent to transcriptionists, often located in other countries. These transcriptionists listen to the clips and type out what they hear, and then the agency assembles the final transcript. The digital reporter often doesn’t review the final transcript or the recording, yet may still falsely certify it as accurate.
As you can probably imagine, there are major problems with this process. Since they're relying on recordings, the final transcript is often full of errors or missing sections. One attorney in California, Melissa B. Buchman, submitted a piece to the Los Angeles &amp; San Francisco Daily Journal about an experience she had with a digital reporter where 55 pages (an entire hour of testimony) was completely left out of the final transcript.
Another issue is that digital reporters don’t handle the security of sensitive information like names, addresses, or birth dates. If there’s a data breach, personal details could be exposed, increasing the risk of identity theft. The way transcripts are shared and stored makes it harder to protect that information.
With digital reporting, there’s just no guarantee of accuracy or confidentiality, leaving room for mistakes and potential security risks. If you're looking into schooling for court reporting, my recommendation is to make sure it's not digital reporting.
<br>Why not record everything?
Recording still needs transcription, which is less efficient and secure. Multiple transcriptionists are needed to match the output of one stenographer, increasing errors and confidentiality risks. Recording alone is outdated.
<br>Is there a shortage of court reporters?
I'll only speak to the situation here in Alberta, but I believe this issue is common in many parts of Canada and the US.
In September 2023, Court of King’s Bench Chief Justice Mary Moreau issued a memo about the use of court reporters in legal proceedings. The memo mentioned a shortage of reporters, which didn’t accurately reflect the situation. ASRA President Di Rocco pointed out that Alberta has 145 certified reporters, a number that’s stable and growing thanks to training programs like NAIT’s. Since these concerns were raised, no trials have gone uncovered, and ASRA was able to bring their issues directly to the Chief of Staff for the Minister of Justice in 2024.
Despite this, some argue that court reporters aren’t needed and off-site transcription is good enough. Shawn King, vice-president of the Criminal Trial Lawyers’ Association, shared this view but acknowledged that off-site transcriptions aren’t always accurate. This is especially true when dealing with unclear audio or background noise, issues an on-site reporter can address in real-time.
But here’s the key question: How many errors would you be comfortable with in a transcript? What if it’s a case that directly affects you? What if it’s a serious crime, like a murder or sexual assault case? Would you be okay with a 10% or 20% error rate? At what point do you see the value of having a court reporter in the courtroom?
So to answer the question: No, there is not a shortage of court reporters. But the future of the profession is a real and ongoing concern.
<br>How do I get into steno? Where do I start?
If you're thinking about a career in steno, you can try out NCRA’s A to Z program (aka Discover Steno, which is also offered by NAIT) for free. It’s a great way to get an introduction to stenography. The program also connects you with experienced court reporters and captioners, so you can ask questions about the field. By the end, you'll have a good understanding of the basics and how to start working toward certification. I took the program myself and highly recommend it; it’s a fantastic way to learn more before committing to a captioning/court reporting program.
