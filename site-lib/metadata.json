I created this site for 3 reasons:\n1. I strongly believe that knowledge should be free and accessible to everyone\n2. I want to help foster a community where the success of one is the success of all\n3. I hope to inspire people to explore the field, whether as a potential career or to appreciate its important role in the legal system and our lives, in generalStenography\n1: the art or process of writing in shorthand\n2: shorthand especially written from dictation or oral discourse\n3: the making of shorthand notes and subsequent transcription of them\nMerriam-Webster.com\nCaptioners and court reporters are professionals who can type at speeds of 225 words per minute or more with at least 95% accuracy using a steno machine. We turn spoken words into written text using our machine and computer technology.Being a captioner or court reporter is a unique and exciting career. Every day is different, and you get to learn new and interesting things all the time. Plus, it has the potential to be quite lucrative. Career opportunities include:\nBroadcast Captioner (live television events and internet programs)\nCART Provider (real-time transcription in educational, corporate, or community settings)\nCourt Reporter (court trials, examinations for discovery, and hearings)\nBut there’s a lot to learn beyond just typing well!Are we being replaced by AI?\nShort answer: No.\nLong answer:\nI don't believe it will be possible to replace court reporters with AI, and this belief stems from two main factors: human cognition and accountability.\nHuman cognition is essential to what we do. Court reporters manage fast speech, accents, crosstalk, mumbling, and background noise in real-time and can ask for clarification on ambiguous terms. We can interrupt the proceedings to ascertain what the speaker said if we missed it. \"Fifteen\" can sound like \"fifty,\" just as \"B\" can sound like \"V.\" Plus, homophones exist – for example, did the speaker say \"write\" or \"right\"? Context plays a vital role too. Did the officer say \"No. Shots were fired,\" or did he say \"No shots were fired\"? A court reporter can hear the distinction; AI can't. And what error rate would you or your client be okay with? 10%? 20%? Hiring a certified court reporter guarantees a near perfect transcript. Additionally, AI datasets have shown significant racial biases.\nCourt reporters ensure the accuracy of the record as impartial third parties. We certify transcripts and are legally responsible for errors. In other words, we display unbiased accountability. Who would be accountable if AI takes down the record incorrectly? The party providing the AI, the company that owns it, or the legal system? Many US courtrooms have already banned AI entirely, and I believe this issue was a major factor in those decisions. The other concern is privacy. One of the 12 major risks to the use of AI is insecurity. There have been multiple occasions when faulty data storage practices resulted in leaked personal data. AI simply cannot be incorporated into a legal setting in its current state.\nPlus, if AI has advanced to the point of replacing humans, I think it’s safe to say that we won’t be the only profession affected.\nWhat is digital reporting?\nA digital reporter operates an audio recording device to capture what happens during a proceeding. The make minimal \"tag notes\" to identify speakers and highlight key moments, but their only record is the audio file itself. They don't take down a complete word-for-word account of everything said and don't use stenography. If the equipment fails due to technical issues or user error, there's no backup. This could seriously harm a case.\nOnce the recording is made, the digital reporter’s job is essentially done. They aren’t responsible for creating the final transcript. Instead, the audio is broken up into smaller clips and sent to transcriptionists, often located in other countries. These transcriptionists listen to the clips and type out what they hear, and then the agency assembles the final transcript. The digital reporter often doesn’t review the final transcript or the recording, yet may still falsely certify it as accurate.\nAs you can probably imagine, there are major problems with this process. Since they're relying on recordings, the final transcript is often full of errors or missing sections. One attorney in California, Melissa B. Buchman, submitted a piece to the Los Angeles &amp; San Francisco Daily Journal about an experience she had with a digital reporter where 55 pages (an entire hour of testimony) was completely left out of the final transcript.\nAnother issue is that digital reporters don’t handle the security of sensitive information like names, addresses, or birth dates. If there’s a data breach, personal details could be exposed, increasing the risk of identity theft. The way transcripts are shared and stored makes it harder to protect that information.\nWith digital reporting, there’s just no guarantee of accuracy or confidentiality, leaving room for mistakes and potential security risks. If you're looking into schooling for court reporting, my recommendation is to make sure it's not digital reporting.\nWhy not record everything?\nRecording still needs transcription, which is less efficient and secure. Multiple transcriptionists are needed to match the output of one stenographer, increasing errors and confidentiality risks. Recording alone is outdated.\nIs there a shortage of court reporters?\nI'll only speak to the situation here in Alberta, but I believe this issue is common in many parts of Canada and the US.\nIn September 2023, Court of King’s Bench Chief Justice Mary Moreau issued a memo about the use of court reporters in legal proceedings. The memo mentioned a shortage of reporters, which didn’t accurately reflect the situation. ASRA President Di Rocco pointed out that Alberta has 145 certified reporters, a number that’s stable and growing thanks to training programs like NAIT’s. Since these concerns were raised, no trials have gone uncovered, and ASRA was able to bring their issues directly to the Chief of Staff for the Minister of Justice in 2024.\nDespite this, some argue that court reporters aren’t needed and off-site transcription is good enough. Shawn King, vice-president of the Criminal Trial Lawyers’ Association, shared this view but acknowledged that off-site transcriptions aren’t always accurate. This is especially true when dealing with unclear audio or background noise, issues an on-site reporter can address in real-time.\nBut here’s the key question: How many errors would you be comfortable with in a transcript? What if it’s a case that directly affects you? What if it’s a serious crime, like a murder or sexual assault case? Would you be okay with a 10% or 20% error rate? At what point do you see the value of having a court reporter in the courtroom?\nSo to answer the question: No, there is not a shortage of court reporters. But the future of the profession is a real and ongoing concern.\nHow do I get into steno? Where do I start?\nIf you're thinking about a career in steno, you can try out NCRA’s A to Z program (aka Discover Steno, which is also offered by NAIT) for free. It’s a great way to get an introduction to stenography. The program also connects you with experienced court reporters and captioners, so you can ask questions about the field. By the end, you'll have a good understanding of the basics and how to start working toward certification. I took the program myself and highly recommend it; it’s a fantastic way to learn more before committing to a captioning/court reporting program.\nIf you have any questions or want to connect, feel
