with Test Anxiety","icon":"","description":"If you're experiencing test anxiety, you're far from alone. I had horrible test anxiety – it was to the point that my hands would be shaking uncontrollably halfway through a test and I'd have to stop writing entirely to just breathe. I've compiled some of the best tips I've come across, and I hope you find them helpful:\nLearn your theory well enough to speed build with it Be honest with yourself and identify gaps in your theory early on Practice at speeds higher than you're testing at to build confidence\nMaintain good posture with your elbows tucked into your waist and your steno machine low enough so that your wrists are stabilized on your thighs\nListen to audio that's faster than the speed you'll be testing at right before the exam Just listen and imagine how you would write the faster audio, don't actually write anything\nThe test will seem manageable in comparison Have a consistent pre-test routine that includes some exercise to burn off adrenaline\nFind your inner zen during the test Remember to breathe - deep breathing/box breathing will slow down your heartrate and ground you Breathe in on \"ready,\" and out on \"begin\" Don't look at your writer - your focus will be pulled away from what you need to write now to what you've already written/failed to write (and any errors you've made) Distract yourself just enough during the test so that the words flow through your fingers effortlessly Suck on a hard candy or chew gum\nClose your eyes and think of something that brings you peace and joy (a colour; a place; a friend, family member, or pet; or a memory) Accept and embrace the nerves There will probably be some nervousness (and its unfortunate symptoms) no matter what you do, so embrace it\nSome of the best public speakers and musicians deal with performance/test anxiety; there's no need to feel embarrassed or ashamed Write something for every word, even if it's gibberish You can't edit or guess at what you meant to write if there's nothing written Always transcribe! More often than not, we think we did worse than we actually did Tell yourself you got this It's nothing you haven't done in practice\nRemember that you're a steno star ⭐ ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Dealing with Test Anxiety","level":1,"id":"Dealing with Test Anxiety"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"0-steno-theory/25-dealing-with-test-anxiety.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1731438090182,"modifiedTime":1732416315204,"sourceSize":2273,"sourcePath":"0 Steno Theory/25 Dealing with Test Anxiety.md","exportPath":"0-steno-theory/25-dealing-with-test-anxiety.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"1-english/0-english-toc.html":{"title":"English TOC","icon":"","description":"\n<a data-href=\"1 Fundamentals\" href=\"1-english/1-fundamentals.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">1 Fundamentals</a>\nGrammar <br><a data-href=\"2 Dependent Clause Combinations\" href=\"1-english/2-dependent-clause-combinations.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2 Dependent Clause Combinations</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"3 Essential vs. Nonessential\" href=\"1-english/3-essential-vs.-nonessential.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">3 Essential vs. Nonessential</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"4 Verbals\" href=\"1-english/4-verbals.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">4 Verbals</a> Punctuation <br><a data-href=\"5 Commas\" href=\"1-english/5-commas.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">5 Commas</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"6 Semicolons &amp;

You write GRAEULT. The untranslate will appear and \"grate.\"Specify the characters that you tend to drag and/or drop in Drag/Drop Analysis Details.While editing, if Drag/Drop Analysis has translated the untranslate correctly, you can press Enter to confirm the translation.To enable: Tools menu in Manage Jobs screen, Options, Translate, Translate, Input tab, select Drag/Drop Analysis, select Details, add keys you tend to drag and drop by clicking on the keyboard diagram (e.g., -L is commonly dragged)TrueStroke Drag/Drop Analysis\nIf using:\nLuminex via USB/Wi-Fi connection\nDiamante via USB/Wi-Fi connection\nWave via USB connection\nCast CAT analyzes untranslates during realtime translation using TrueStroke data located in the Steno X-subfile to match a steno outline in a dictionary being used to translate.\nTrueStroke Drag/Drop has priority over Drag/Drop Analysis if both options are selected.While editing, if TrueStroke Drag/Drop has translated the untranslate correctly, you can press Enter to confirm the translation.To enable: Tools menu in Manage Jobs screen, Options, Translate, Translate, Input tab, select TrueStroke Drag/Drop Analysis. No other action required.When active, Case CAT translate, by default, steno outlines accidentally stroked with a dragged letter -G, -S, or -D as a suffix letter tucked inside a steno outline.Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker allows you to select whether dragged steno should be considered a suffix or a word.Suffix Drag\nSuffix Drag applies the suffix strokes -G, -S, -Z, or -D to single-stroke untranslates when the dragged letter is the last character in the outline.The translated text will be surrounded by Suffix Drag Begin and End format symbols.For example, \"blog\" is defined in your Personal Dictionary, but the steno stroke BLOGD is not. The untranslate will appear as \"blogged.\"Set Suffix Drag Options by clicking the Details button. Use -S, -Z, or both for a plural suffix. Tuckable suffixes are permitted. For example, the untranslated SLAOEGT would translate as \"sleeting.\"Phrase Maker\nFor example, let's say the steno stroke TPH-GT is not defined in the dictionary. However, you have TPH defined as \"in\" and -GT is set as a \"word\" type in your Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker Options as the word \"this.\"With the Word option in Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker, you can have TPH-GT translate as \"in this\" even though it is not defined in your dictionary as a single stroke.Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker only applies to one-stroke words in which steno characters can be added as a suffix. Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker options allow you to add other steno characters you want Case CAT to consider a suffix.The Plural Endings Options allow you to use the final S, final Z, or both for plural endings. To confirm the combined words are spelled correctly, set the Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker Spell Check option for the steno outline.If Spell Check is active, Case CAT checks the newly combined word to confirm the combined word is spelled correctly. If a correctly spelled word is not found, Case CAT tries the next possible suffix to find an actual word. This may result in a correctly spelled word but not the word intended. If Case CAT does not find a correctly spelled word with an added suffix, the steno outline remains an untranslate and no conversion takes place. The Spellchecked option has no influence on phrases created by Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker.If also using TrueStroke Drag/Drop or Drag/Drop Analysis, TrueStroke Drag/Drop and then Drag/Drop Analysis takes priority.To enable: Tools menu in Manage Jobs screen, Options, Translate, Input tab, select Suffix Drag/Phrase Maker, select Details, add a new entry by clicking on the blank row at the bottom of the listSome common phrasing:Delete Repeated Q/A/C\nIf multiple Qs, As, or Colloquy paragraphs (with the same name) are written on right after another with no text in between, Case CAT will automatically delete the empty paragraphs so only one paragraph displays.For example, if you write the steno outline defined as &lt;Question&gt; five times in a row without text, only one Q will display in the transcript.Use Smart Quotes\nBy selecting this option, you only need one dictionary definition for a quotation mark. When you write the steno defined as a quotation mark (\") the first time in a paragraph, Case CAT inserts an opening quote. When you write that same steno outline again, Case CAT inserts a closing quote.If you wrote the steno defined as quotation mark once and did not write it again to close the quotation, Case CAT automatically puts a closing quote at the end of the current paragraph styleFor CACR students, this option should be selected.Use Smart Parentheses\nBy selecting this option, you only need one dictionary definition for a parenthesis or bracket. When you write the steno defined as the open parenthesis or bracket the first time, Case CAT inserts an open parenthesis or bracket. When you write the same steno outline a second time, Case CAT inserts a closed parenthesis or bracket.If you wrote the steno defined as open parenthesis or bracket once but did not write it again, Case CAT automatically inserts the closed parenthesis or bracket at the end of the current paragraph.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Translate Options","level":1,"id":"Translate Options"},{"heading":"Drag/Drop Analysis","level":2,"id":"Drag/Drop_Analysis"},{"heading":"Suffix Drag Phase Maker","level":2,"id":"Suffix_Drag_Phase_Maker"},{"heading":"Delete Repeating Q/A/C, Use Smart Quotes and Smart Parentheses","level":2,"id":"Delete_Repeating_Q/A/C,_Use_Smart_Quotes_and_Smart_Parentheses"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"5-writing-realtime/3-translate-options.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730396930491,"modifiedTime":1732428025390,"sourceSize":5837,"sourcePath":"5 Writing Realtime/3 Translate Options.md","exportPath":"5-writing-realtime/3-translate-options.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"5-writing-realtime/4-advanced-translate-options.html":{"title":"Advanced Translate Options","icon":"","description":"This feature works in conjunction with Translate's Drag/Drop Analysis feature and at least one steno character is selected as either a dragged or dropped character.

The good news is that it is a skill that can be practiced and even perfected, and it can become a valuable tool in your realtime career.While fingerspelling is not a substitute for a solid, conflict-free theory and a good workign set of prefixes, suffixes, and word roots, it is an excellent way to handle the occasional oddball word or name that will will inevitably hear on the job.Once you've determined how you will write your fingerspelling alphabet, it's time to practice it. Just as you needed to drill yourself on shorthand speed, you probably will also need to do the same with your fingerspelling skills. Practice at home with random words picked out of the dictionary; experiment with it while practicing for accuracy.Start with small words and work up to longer ones. Work to achieve a steady rhythm as you spell, rather than frantic, jerky bursts. You'll be surprised how quickly that word can come out, if you don't panic!

Double clicking a Live Suggestion will replace the untranslate.Modify Brief It Options\nFrom the All Options dialog box, under Edit Panes, select Brief It.\nFrom the Brief It pane, click the Options icon.\nFrom Manage Jobs, press Alt t, o, e, b (Tools, Options, Edit, Brief It).\nFrom Edit, press Alt t, o, Enter, b (Tools, Options, Pane Options, Brief It).\nShow Phonetic Steno\nCheck this box to have Brief It display steno as it sounds. For example, the suggested brief for \"Yoko Ono\" would appear as Y*O as opposed to KWR*O.When Show Phonetic Steno is selected, steno in the Cat Scratch Text/Steno section will also display phonetically.Only Suggest 1 Stroke Briefs\nCheck this box to have Brief It suggest only one-stroke Suggested briefs. By default, Brief It always suggests a one-stroke brief with the asterisk before suggesting a two-stroke brief.Selecting this option also affects Reminder and Personal briefs. For example, you write \"neurotoxicity\" in four or five strokes. When this option is active, Brief It does not remind you that you have TPHAOUR/TOX in your Personal Dictionary as a two-stroke entry.Write Twice to Define\nBrief It, by default, automatically creates a J-Define or a K-Define the first time you use a Suggested brief. Checking this box requires you to consecutively write a brief twice before Brief It creates a J-Define or K-Define. You may want to use this option to try a Suggested brief before making it a definition.For example, Brief It suggests A*BT for \"Abbott Labs.\" If the Write twice to Define option is active, you would need to write A*BT/A*BT to have Case CAT create the global. Once defined, you write A*BT for \"Abbott Labs\" for the remainder of the job.Define to Case Dictionary\nCheck this box to place a Suggested brief in the case dictionary once it is written. If the current job is not in a case, then the brief is placed in the job dictionary.Personal/Reminders Only\nCheck this box to display only Reminder and Personal briefs in the Brief It dialog pane. Suggested briefs are not created.1 Stroke Reminders for 2 Strokes\nCheck this box to have Brief It offer one-stroke Reminders or Personal briefs when writing two-stroke entries. For example, if you write \"I don't\" in two strokes and there is a one-stroke version in your Personal Dictionary, Brief It shows the one-stroke brief as a Reminder.Auto Open Brief It\nCheck this box to automatically display the Brief It dialog pane when starting realtime. By default, this option is selected.Send Used Briefs to Cat Scratch\nCheck this box to automatically send a Suggested brief you use to the Steno/Text section of the Cat Scratch dialog pane.Steno Include/Exclude\nDisplays the Brief It Options table where you can modify the Require and Exclude entries.The Require entry contains the steno character or steno combination to be included in every Suggested brief. There is only one Require entry.Exclude entries contain steno characters or steno combinations to exclude from every Suggested brief. You can have multiple Exclude entries.Personal Briefs\nPersonal Briefs are entries which are created prior to translation and are stored in the Briefs.txt file in the System Files case. A default Briefs.txt file exists for each user.Creating entries in the Briefs.txt file allows you to store words and phrases along with the brief form without placing them in a dictionary. For example, you got some good ideas for briefs from an article in the JCR but you're not certain you want to put them in your Personal Dictionary.Common Words\nThe CommonWords.txt file contains a list of words the Brief It does not consider when looking for words and phrases for brief suggestions. Is a phrase is written that begins or ends with a word from the CommonWords.txt file, no brief is suggested. For example, by default the word \"about\" is in the CommonWords.txt file. When a phrase is written that begins or ends with the word \"about\" and no Reminder or Personal brief exists for the word or phrase, Brief It does not suggest a brief.Allow Briefs with Numbers\nCheck this box to have Brief It offer suggestions for repeated dollar amounts or addresses.An additional option is available in the Steno Include/Exclude list where a Required for Numbers entry is available. For example if the Required for Numbers entry is EU and you write 23925 several times throughout the transcript, Brief It might suggest 23EU9. (EU is the default steno entry.)Be default, the following number/steno key combinations are excluded in the Brief Include/Exclude Options: #1S, #2K, #3W, #4R, #6-R, #7-B, #8-G, #9-STo prevent any number bar number from being suggested, press Ctrl + i and type # and press Enter.Allow Double First Syllable\nCheck this box to have Brief It offer the first syllable of the text (single word or phrase) written twice as the suggested brief. For example, the word \"fluorescent\" is used multiple times in the transcript. You write \"fluorescent\" in multiple strokes and Brief It suggests TPHROR/TPHROR.When you have both Write Twice to Define and Allow Double First Syllable options selected, if the suggested brief has two identical strokes, Brief It will behave as if \"Write Twice to Define\" option was not active. In other words, you do not need to write the brief four times to use it. If the brief is one stroke or is multiple (not identical) strokes, briefs will need to be written twice to be used.No Nag List\nCheck this box to designate words or phrases that should no longer be offered as a suggestion or a reminder. For example, you have the phrase \"of the\" in your Personal Dictionary, but sometimes you write it in two strokes. You do not want Brief It to remind you of the phrase.From the Brief It pane, right click an entry or highlight multiple entries and then right click. Select Send Text to No Nag List. Alternatively, select No Nag List in Brief It options and type the text portion of the entry.Insert Oops when replacing with a live suggestion\nSelect to add an &lt;Oops&gt; format symbol (category 10) whenever you select to replace an untranslate with a Live Suggestion. This enables you to scan to Live Suggestion replacements and confirm change. You can also view each instance in the Hotspots pane.Number of Suggestions\nSelect how many suggestions should be offered in the Brief It pane. Select from 2 to 5 suggestions. The default number of suggestions is 3.Dictionary Defines go to\nSelect the destination dictionary you want a defined suggestion to go to when using the {Define With LS#} commands. When this option is set to case dictionary and the transcript is not in a case, entries will go to the job dictionary.Show \"translated\" text as first Live Suggestions\nBy default, this option is active and Drag/Drop, Suffix Drag, and phonetically translated text will be the first choice in the Live Suggestion list.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Brief It! and Live Suggestions","level":1,"id":"Brief It! and Live Suggestions"},{"heading":"Intro","level":2,"id":"Intro"},{"heading":"Live Suggestions Into","level":2,"id":"Live_Suggestions_Into"},{"heading":"Configure Brief It & Live Suggestions","level":2,"id":"Configure_Brief_It_&_Live_Suggestions"},{"heading":"Suggested Configurations","level":2,"id":"Suggested_Configurations"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"5-writing-realtime/8-brief-it!-and-live-suggestions.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730396930497,"modifiedTime":1732428034423,"sourceSize":11994,"sourcePath":"5 Writing Realtime/8 Brief It! and Live Suggestions.md","exportPath":"5-writing-realtime/8-brief-it!-and-live-suggestions.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"5-writing-realtime/9-phonetic-translation.html":{"title":"Phonetic Translation","icon":"","description":"What is it?\nWhen active, Case CAT phonetically translates steno outlines when no match is found in any dictionary used for translation.

It utilizes integrated live display and scripted program features. A variety of windowing options allow you to view your realtime translation, make corrections to the translation, preview the text that displays on the viewer’s television and organize your story scripts. Additional features include the ability to view your vertical notes, session selections, and the status of the captioning mode.Click (the BCS Captioning button) on the Function Bar or click Function, Broadcast Captioning Suite (or press Alt+u, b).Captioning Options\nCaption Translate options are a group of settings that affect how CATalyst BCS translates steno outlines. You set translate options on the Options tab in the Caption Options dialog box prior to starting a session or during a captioning session using the Options feature on the Setup menu. Options settings remain the same until you change them.There are three translate options specific to BCS.Remove Single Empty Paragraph\nSuppress the blank line generated when a steno outline with a paragraph style is followed by a stroke defined with a paragraph style at the beginning of the definition.\nReplace Q&amp;A With &gt;&gt;\nConverts Question and Answer format symbol to chevrons (&gt;&gt;).\nHold Strokes\nWhen active, steno outlines are held before displaying the translated text on the live display. CATalyst BCS holds the steno until it finds the longest dictionary match plus the specified number of additional strokes. Once a longest match is found, BCS re-translates the steno outlines to display the longest match text. If no steno is written for a specified number of seconds, then the translated text or steno on the screen displays regardless of the longest match.\nFor example, let's say your Longest match plus X strokes option is set to 3 and the Held for X seconds option is set to 2. You write a four-stroke word which is a longest match plus three more strokes. When the longest match plus the additional strokes are written, CATalyst pushes out the translation. If translation isn't done with the longest match, it will hold back the translation for 2 seconds.

The minimum requirements recommended by Stenograph are included below. However, most laptops on sale now will meet or exceed them.Some advice as you begin your search:\nSet a budget and buy the most RAM and hard drive space available within your budget.\nA solid-state drive (SSD) is recommended over an HDD, but either one will suit your needs.\nConsider the weight of the laptop as you will be carrying is around when you start working. You can purchase an external monitor and wireless keyboard/mouse for use at home to increase your workspace.\nKeyboard and touchpad - try it before you buy it! Type on it and see how it feels, if it's noisy, and whether your finger can easily reach the enter key. Some keyboards have the enter key a little farther away which makes it harder to reach.\nA minimum of three UDB ports. If the laptop you like has less than three, you may want to purchase a USB hub. The ports are needed to hook up various devices to your computer. Operating System Windows 10\nProcessor speed of 2GHz or higher\nintel i3, i5, i7, or AMD equivalent is strongly recommended RAM (Memory) 4 GB of RAM or more is required if using the RealTeam feature Hard Drive 40 GB hard drive with at least 20 GB of free space\n80 GB hard drive or larger is recommended Video Card A DirectX 9 compatible video card with a minimum of 256 MB Video RAM.

You may use pre-made stickers instead of stamps if they fit on the document being marked To facilitate quick reference by counsel, placement of the exhibit stamp should be the top right corner of any document.&nbsp;If the top right corner is not available, place the stamp as close to the top of the document as possible.&nbsp;If there is no place on the entire face of the document to put the exhibit stamp, place the stamp on the back of the document. It is prudent practice to let counsel know that you are putting the exhibit stamp on the back of the document. Make sure when you are placing the stamp, that the stamp does not touch any written portion of the document.\nWhen marking photographs, have prepared exhibit stamp stickers to place on the back of the photograph.&nbsp;The ink smudges when you stamp the back of photographs (with the shiny finish).&nbsp; Stickers are often used for documents as well.\nThe reporter would include the following information in the exhibit stamp:\nSequential number (or letter if marked for identification)\nFull name of witness (same as given when sworn in, all caps)\nDate of examination\nReporter’s name and initials\nFull exhibits receive a number designation (\"D\" for discovery):\n“Pasted image 20240718000440.png” could not be found.Exhibits for identification receive a letter designation:“Pasted image 20240718000549.png” could not be found.\nOR\n“Pasted image 20240718000559.png” could not be found.Exhibits marked in a cross-examination on Affidavit do not have the letter \"D\":\n“Pasted image 20240718000626.png” could not be found.Discussions off the Record\nThe reporter goes off the record only when both sides agree to go off the record If opposing counsel gives no response or any type of indication to the requesting counsel wanting to go off the record, the reporter can assume opposing counsel is fine with going off the record. The reporter should make it obvious that he or she is not writing anything that is being said.&nbsp; Make an attempt to be obvious that you are off the record.\nWhen counsel make the request to go off the record, it is recorded in the transcript unless the lawyer talks directly to the reporter only to go off the record; however, when the request is made to go back on the record, that is not included in the transcript.\nWhen counsel are discussing whether or not to go off the record, that is included in the transcript.\nInterrupting Speakers\nUnlike clarifying the spelling of a word, you must make the interruption immediately to clarify something not heard or understood. If you hesitate, the speakers move on, and it is difficult to capture the moment again.\nSay something short and to the point (“pardon me”) while making eye contact with the speaker.&nbsp;\nIf you are clarifying a word that you think is the response but are not satisfied, repeat the response to the speaker.&nbsp; For example: Did you say “yes”? If you didn’t hear an answer, don’t expect your audio to pick up the sound.\nIf you are unsure whether you heard a name or word correctly and can put that word into context later, make a notation and clarify the word during a break.&nbsp;If it's a proper name, you will have to get the spelling anyway.\nWitnesses with accents can be difficult to understand, so be sure to advise examining counsel you are experiencing this difficulty.&nbsp; Lawyers can then change the way they ask questions and will understand if you are interrupting often.\nTo clarify the spelling of a word, make a notation in your transcript.&nbsp;\"Oops\" is a good Case CAT feature for this!&nbsp;You can then ask your questions at the next break. A good resource for the spelling of proper nouns is from the documents themselves.&nbsp;Otherwise, you will direct your question to the witness or counsel to get a spelling.&nbsp;Record the information directly into your transcript or on your information page.&nbsp;\nThe internet is a great resource for researching names of geographic areas, company names, street names, etc.&nbsp;\nIt should be the goal of the reporter to clarify any information needed before they leave the discovery room. It will save time when editing.\nYou can try to tell a witness to slow down, but it often doesn't work. Do not interrupt if the lawyer is going for the \"kill,\" the witness is reacting to the questions and not thinking, don't spoil the lawyer's train of thought or give the witness time to think.\nInterjections\nOne of the biggest adjustments NAIT graduates have when they start out in industry is writing interjections by the witness's lawyer. One way to best deal with this scenario is to anticipate when an interjection or objection will be made.\nHere is a list of possible reasons for an interjection or objection from opposing counsel:\nHypothetical questions.&nbsp;Examining counsel are not allowed to ask hypothetical questions, e.g., \"If you weren't speeding, do you think the accident would have happened?\"\nQuestions that ask for an opinion.&nbsp;Examining counsel are not allowed to ask for an opinion from the witness unless the witness is called as an expert in a specific field, e.g., \"Do you think Mr. Jones did a good job in his position as manager?\" gray area when it's about the witness's frame of mind\nQuestions that do not relate to the pleadings in a questioning for discovery or questions that do not fall within the “four corners” of an affidavit in a cross-examination on affidavit, e.g., if we had a car accident, and the witness was not claiming future loss of income because they got over their injuries after a certain amount of time, examining counsel cannot ask questions about their future employment and potential income\nWhen examining counsel asks for an undertaking - lawyer will usually step in and answer for the witness\nWhen the questioning becomes heated between the counsel and the witness, the witness’s lawyer may interject to protect his or her witness, i.e., they will make an objection just to stop the proceeding and give their witness's a chance to compose themselves again and think about their answers\nThe body language of the witness’s lawyer.&nbsp;Many times the witness’s lawyer will put his hand in front of witness or move up to the end of his chair so the witness knows not to answer the question and the lawyer can interject.\nNote: In Canadian proceedings, witnesses do not answer questions that are objected to.&nbsp;You may see the witness answering in the demo videos from NCRA Career Launcher.Readbacks\nReporter readbacks must be performed proficiently upon request.&nbsp;Many times the competency of the reporter is judged by their ability to read back.\nWhen asked to read back, take your time.&nbsp;Review your text or vertical notes prior to beginning the readback.\nThe readback should be in a loud, clear voice at a steady pace (approximately 140 wpm). You must give the speaker identification first, e.g., \"Question: Where were you on the night in question? Answer: I was - Speaker: Ms. Smith: Don't answer that.\"\nReadbacks should be read with back-up equipment on. If the readback is not the last question or answer, highlight or mark the spot that was read back, and copy and paste in the appropriate spot.\nSometimes the readback requested is not only the last question asked or answer given but is not specific. If necessary, ask clarifying questions to determine what is being requested to be read.\nIf you need a few minutes to find the portion to read back or would like to review it with the audio backup, ask for a brief adjournment.\nObtaining Spellings\nTo clarify the spelling of a word, make a notation in your steno notes or make a note on your information page. You can then get the spelling at the next break.\nThe best place to get spellings is from the documents themselves. Otherwise, depending on the spelling needed, you will have to ask the witness or possibly counsel to get a spelling. Once you receive the spelling, record the spelling directly into your transcript and/or in the top right-hand corner on the back of your information page. Some spellings, like geography and company names, can also be attained from the Internet.\nIn terms of spellings, it should be the goal of the reporter to attain all necessary spellings before he/she leaves the questioning room. As the reporter, you don't want to waste time when producing the transcript having to look things up.\nIndicating Non-Verbal Actions\nWhen a witness nods his head to indicate “yes” or shakes his head to indicate “no”, counsel may ask for a verbal response.&nbsp; If they do not, you may indicate to counsel there was no verbal response.\nIf a witness uses a body motion to answer a question, counsel may describe the motion on the record or ask the witness to describe it.\nQ Where did you hit your head?&nbsp; (Witness points to his head)&nbsp; &nbsp;(New Paragraph)\nI notice you are indicating the left temple area; is that correct?\nA Correct.&nbsp;\nIf the lawyer doesn't do this, the reporter should interrupt and indicate there was no verbal response on the record.\nWe do not describe non-verbal actions in the record. There's no way to verify and it can be left to interpretation.\nHeated Arguments\nIf there is a heated argument between counsel and the witness, do not interrupt and do the best you can.\nIf the heated argument is between counsel and their speech is overlapping, immediately step in and remind them to speak one at a time.\nConversation by Third Parties\nIf an observer/layperson speaks during a questioning and is not at the time under oath, immediately interject and ask whether the comments are to be included in the record.\nIf the comments are included in the record, the speaker is identified in colloquy format, e.g., MR. BROWN:\nHandling Adjournments\nSimilar to discussions off the record, all counsel must agree to adjourn.\nLike discussions off the record, the reporter quits writing when both sides agree to adjourn.\nApply Professional Conduct During Proceedings\nYou should provide professional conduct from the time you leave your home until you get back. How you act and present yourself during discussions off the record, adjournments, and in setting up and dismantling your equipment is just as important as when you write the proceeding. Ask counsel if they would like to order a transcript\nCheck for delivery deadlines Regular (5-10 business days)\nExpedited (3-5 business days)\nNext day Counsel may sometimes put a transcript order on hold. This means they don't want it produced right away but may order a copy in the future. Questionings in Aid Upload backup digital files to your computer\nHave all files named and properly organized\nObtain spellings from counsel or witness that you likely won't be able to find yourself\nBe personable and polite\nPrepare the Transcript\nWrite Goal is to get everything down and as accurate as possible. In essence, write like you have no back-up audio.\nAsk counsel or the witness for spellings you won't be able to easily find. Edit with audio Edit the transcript applying the rules of proper grammar and punctuation\nMark spots where further research may be needed Proofread with audio Proofread carefully with the audio Proofread without audio Read for context\nYou don't know what you don't know! Check everything! Proofreading Tips for New Reporters\nNew reporters may find proofreading on paper is more effective\nAlways proofread for context first; ensure the punctuation portrays the correct meaning\nRead one word at a time; spelling errors and misused words are common errors\nCheck the page for proper formatting and speaker tokens\nIf your mentor is proofreading your transcripts, keep a log of common errors.

E.g., if you take the questioning of 3 witnesses in one day, each witness's transcript will begin with page 1, exhibit 1, and undertaking 1 Court trials/quasi-judicial trials are case-based, i.e., proceedings are continuous and don't start over for each individual witness Transcript page numbers &amp; exhibit numbers carry on throughout the whole proceeding Generally speaking, an examining lawyer only gets one chance to examine a witness from the other side during the questioning for discovery stage. However, sometimes a witness is examined at a discovery, and the examining lawyer will not finish his or her questioning or will have finished questioning subject to the undertakings that were given or new documents that may be produced into evidence before trial. When the lawyer comes back to question the witness a second time on a different date, this is called a continuation.\nWhy might a questioning be continued? adjourned (to a specified date) or adjourned sine die (to a date in the future)\nadjourned subject to the undertakings (very specific adjournment where further questioning may only apply to the undertakings)\nreopen a concluded questioning (because new documents were filed or new information has come to light) At the time the booking is made, the reporting firm will generally ask if it is a continuation so the reporter knows before they attend the discovery.\nHow else might a reporter know it's a continuation? Multiday bookings\nFirm may advise the proceedings are continued\nCounsel may advise the proceedings are continued\nReporter may inquire whether the proceedings are continued When a reporter is reporting a continuation of a questioning for discovery, they will request the last page number, the last exhibit number, and the last undertaking number from the previous examination. Paragraph numbers are not applied in Alberta transcripts, but you may encounter them in other jurisdictions (also witness-based and continued on further questioning dates) The cover page will then read \"Continued Questioning for Discovery of ^Witness's Name^\"\nThe reporter at a continuation may ask examining counsel if they would like the witness resworn.&nbsp; The sworn notation may then read:\n^WITNESS'S NAME^, Sworn, Questioned by ^Lawyer's Name^\n^WITNESS'S NAME^, Previously Sworn, Questioned by ^Lawyer's Name^\nExample“Pasted image 20240717234923.png” could not be found.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Continuations","level":1,"id":"Continuations"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"6-the-business/16-continuations.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730396930539,"modifiedTime":1732413671176,"sourceSize":2555,"sourcePath":"6 The Business/16 Continuations.md","exportPath":"6-the-business/16-continuations.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"6-the-business/17-american-depositions.html":{"title":"American Depositions","icon":"","description":"You may find an American lawsuit where one of the witnesses lives in Canada and, as a result, they conduct the deposition here.Formatting and Title Page\nMost firms in Canada will use their regular discovery format.\nThe style of cause is different in American depositions and will be transposed on the title page in a similar format as that given to them. The rest of the title page will remain the same.\nMajor Differences Between Questionings and Depositions\nIn most cases, the transcript is first sent to the witness with a covering letter.\nThe witness can make any changes to the transcripts it wants to. To do this, the witness will fill out an errata sheet attached to the back of the transcript. The errata sheet will contain (1) the page and line number of each change, (2) the actual change itself, (3) the reason for the change, (4) signature by witness certifying that the deposition is correct as stated with the exceptions noted above, and (5) the date that the errata sheet was filled out.\nIn administering the oath, the witness raises his right hand, no Bible, no standing. The witness is sworn, not affirmed.\nExhibits marked in the deposition are attached to the back of the transcript and become part of the actual transcript.\nThe certificate filled out by the reporter is much more in depth.\nHaving a videographer present in a deposition is much more common that in questionings in Canada.\nIn most depositions if the witness's counsel makes an objection to a question, the witness still answers the question after the objection has been made. In Canada, the witness will not answer and the examining lawyer will have to go to Chambers and receive a ruling in his favor to get the witness to answer.\nAmerican lawyers, when they conduct a deposition in Canada, almost always pay in American dollars.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"American Depositions","level":1,"id":"American Depositions"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"6-the-business/17-american-depositions.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730396930541,"modifiedTime":1732413674100,"sourceSize":1869,"sourcePath":"6 The Business/17 American Depositions.md","exportPath":"6-the-business/17-american-depositions.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"6-the-business/18-proceedings.html":{"title":"18 Proceedings","icon":"","description":"Virtual proceedings are secure, economic, and just as effective as in-person proceedings.\nAccounts needed/must be familiar with the following: Zoom\nWebEx\nMicrosoft Teams\nAdobe Connect Either the firm or the individual court reporter will invite participants\nPreparation\nStart time (arrive 30 minutes before start time)\nIntroduce yourself to each person and confirm their identity/their role\nTroubleshooting?

These hearings are often related to regulatory, administrative, or disciplinary actions. Here is an overview of the quasi-judicial hearing process:\nComplaint/Petition: The process begins with the filing of a complaint, petition, or application by an individual, organization, or government entity. This initiates the case and sets the procedural wheels in motion.\nNotice of Hearing: The parties involved are notified about the hearing. This notice includes the date, time, place, and nature of the hearing, ensuring that all parties have adequate time to prepare. Preliminary Conference: Sometimes, a preliminary conference is held to clarify issues, set timelines, and discuss procedural matters.\nDiscovery: Similar to judicial proceedings, parties may engage in discovery to gather evidence and information from each other. Administrative Law Judge (ALJ): The hearing is typically presided over by an Administrative Law Judge or a panel. The ALJ or panel acts as an impartial arbiter.\nOpening Statements: Both parties may present opening statements to outline their positions and the evidence they intend to present.\nPresentation of Evidence: Evidence is presented by both sides. This includes witness testimonies, documents, and other relevant materials. Witnesses may be cross-examined by the opposing party.\nRules of Evidence: While formal rules of evidence may be relaxed compared to judicial proceedings, the ALJ ensures that evidence presented is relevant and reliable.\nRecord of Proceedings: The entire hearing is typically recorded and transcribed to ensure there is an accurate record for review. Briefs and Arguments: Parties may be allowed to submit post-hearing briefs or written arguments summarizing their positions and the evidence presented.\nDeliberation and Decision: The ALJ or panel reviews the evidence and arguments, deliberates, and makes a decision based on the merits of the case.\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law: The decision includes findings of fact and conclusions of law, detailing the reasoning behind the decision.\nIssuance of Decision: The decision is issued in writing and provided to all parties involved. This document outlines the outcome and any orders or sanctions imposed. Internal Appeals: There may be an internal appeals process within the agency or body, where the decision can be reviewed by a higher authority within the same organization.\nJudicial Review: Parties dissatisfied with the decision may seek judicial review in a court of law. The court reviews the administrative record and determines whether the quasi-judicial body acted within its authority and followed proper procedures. Implementation of Decision: The decision is enforced as per the agency's or body's rules. This may involve sanctions, penalties, or other actions as prescribed in the decision.\nCompliance Monitoring: The agency may monitor compliance with the decision and take further action if necessary.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Quasi-Judicial Hearings","level":1,"id":"Quasi-Judicial Hearings"},{"heading":"Introduction","level":4,"id":"Introduction"},{"heading":"Initiation","level":4,"id":"Initiation"},{"heading":"Pre-Hearing Procedures","level":4,"id":"Pre-Hearing_Procedures"},{"heading":"The Hearing","level":4,"id":"The_Hearing"},{"heading":"Post-Hearing Procedures","level":4,"id":"Post-Hearing_Procedures"},{"heading":"Appeals","level":4,"id":"Appeals"},{"heading":"Enforcement","level":4,"id":"Enforcement"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"6-the-business/21-quasi-judicial-hearings.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730396930545,"modifiedTime":1732427953392,"sourceSize":4163,"sourcePath":"6 The Business/21 Quasi-Judicial Hearings.md","exportPath":"6-the-business/21-quasi-judicial-hearings.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"index.html":{"title":"Index","icon":"","description":"Welcome!\nStenoTab is a compilation of all my notes from NAIT's Captioning and Court Reporting program. I created this site for 3 reasons:\n1. I strongly believe that knowledge should be free and accessible to everyone\n2. I want to help foster a community where the success of one is the success of all\n3. I hope to inspire people to explore the field, whether as a potential career or to appreciate its important role in the legal system and our lives, in generalStenography\n1: the art or process of writing in shorthand\n2: shorthand especially written from dictation or oral discourse\n3: the making of shorthand notes and subsequent transcription of them\nMerriam-Webster.com\nCaptioners and court reporters are professionals who can type at speeds of 225 words per minute or more with at least 95% accuracy using a steno machine. We turn spoken words into written text using our machine and computer technology.Being a captioner or court reporter is a unique and exciting career. Every day is different, and you get to learn new and interesting things all the time. Plus, it has the potential to be quite lucrative. Career opportunities include:\nBroadcast Captioner (live television events and internet programs)\nCART Provider (real-time transcription in educational, corporate, or community settings)\nCourt Reporter (court trials, examinations for discovery, and hearings)\nBut there’s a lot to learn beyond just typing well!Are we being replaced by AI?\nShort answer: No.\nLong answer:\nI don't believe it will be possible to replace court reporters with AI, and this belief stems from two main factors: human cognition and accountability.\nHuman cognition is essential to what we do. Court reporters manage fast speech, accents, crosstalk, mumbling, and background noise in real-time and can ask for clarification on ambiguous terms. We can interrupt the proceedings to ascertain what the speaker said if we missed it. \"Fifteen\" can sound like \"fifty,\" just as \"B\" can sound like \"V.\" Plus, homophones exist – for example, did the speaker say \"write\" or \"right\"? Context plays a vital role too. Did the officer say \"No. Shots were fired,\" or did he say \"No shots were fired\"? A court reporter can hear the distinction; AI can't. And what error rate would you or your client be okay with? 10%? 20%? Hiring a certified court reporter guarantees a near perfect transcript. Additionally, AI datasets have shown significant racial biases.\nCourt reporters ensure the accuracy of the record as impartial third parties. We certify transcripts and are legally responsible for errors. In other words, we display unbiased accountability. Who would be accountable if AI takes down the record incorrectly? The party providing the AI, the company that owns it, or the legal system? Many US courtrooms have already banned AI entirely, and I believe this issue was a major factor in those decisions. The other concern is privacy. One of the 12 major risks to the use of AI is insecurity. There have been multiple occasions when faulty data storage practices resulted in leaked personal data. AI simply cannot be incorporated into a legal setting in its current state.\nPlus, if AI has advanced to the point of replacing humans, I think it’s safe to say that we won’t be the only profession affected.\nWhat is digital reporting?\nA digital reporter operates an audio recording device to capture what happens during a proceeding. The make minimal \"tag notes\" to identify speakers and highlight key moments, but their only record is the audio file itself. They don't take down a complete word-for-word account of everything said and don't use stenography. If the equipment fails due to technical issues or user error, there's no backup. This could seriously harm a case.\nOnce the recording is made, the digital reporter’s job is essentially done. They aren’t responsible for creating the final transcript. Instead, the audio is broken up into smaller clips and sent to transcriptionists, often located in other countries. These transcriptionists listen to the clips and type out what they hear, and then the agency assembles the final transcript. The digital reporter often doesn’t review the final transcript or the recording, yet may still falsely certify it as accurate.\nAs you can probably imagine, there are major problems with this process. Since they're relying on recordings, the final transcript is often full of errors or missing sections. One attorney in California, Melissa B. Buchman, submitted a piece to the Los Angeles &amp; San Francisco Daily Journal about an experience she had with a digital reporter where 55 pages (an entire hour of testimony) was completely left out of the final transcript.\nAnother issue is that digital reporters don’t handle the security of sensitive information like names, addresses, or birth dates. If there’s a data breach, personal details could be exposed, increasing the risk of identity theft. The way transcripts are shared and stored makes it harder to protect that information.\nWith digital reporting, there’s just no guarantee of accuracy or confidentiality, leaving room for mistakes and potential security risks. If you're looking into schooling for court reporting, my recommendation is to make sure it's not digital reporting.\nWhy not record everything?\nRecording still needs transcription, which is less efficient and secure. Multiple transcriptionists are needed to match the output of one stenographer, increasing errors and confidentiality risks. Recording alone is outdated.\nIs there a shortage of court reporters?\nI'll only speak to the situation here in Alberta, but I believe this issue is common in many parts of Canada and the US.\nIn September 2023, Court of King’s Bench Chief Justice Mary Moreau issued a memo about the use of court reporters in legal proceedings. The memo mentioned a shortage of reporters, which didn’t accurately reflect the situation. ASRA President Di Rocco pointed out that Alberta has 145 certified reporters, a number that’s stable and growing thanks to training programs like NAIT’s. Since these concerns were raised, no trials have gone uncovered, and ASRA was able to bring their issues directly to the Chief of Staff for the Minister of Justice in 2024.\nDespite this, some argue that court reporters aren’t needed and off-site transcription is good enough. Shawn King, vice-president of the Criminal Trial Lawyers’ Association, shared this view but acknowledged that off-site transcriptions aren’t always accurate. This is especially true when dealing with unclear audio or background noise, issues an on-site reporter can address in real-time.\nBut here’s the key question: How many errors would you be comfortable with in a transcript? What if it’s a case that directly affects you? What if it’s a serious crime, like a murder or sexual assault case? Would you be okay with a 10% or 20% error rate? At what point do you see the value of having a court reporter in the courtroom?\nSo to answer the question: No, there is not a shortage of court reporters. But the future of the profession is a real and ongoing concern.\nHow do I get into steno? Where do I start?\nIf you're thinking about a career in steno, you can try out NCRA’s A to Z program (aka Discover Steno, which is also offered by NAIT) for free. It’s a great way to get an introduction to stenography. The program also connects you with experienced court reporters and captioners, so you can ask questions about the field. By the end, you'll have a good understanding of the basics and how to start working toward certification. I took the program myself and highly recommend it; it’s a fantastic way to learn more before committing to a captioning/court reporting program.\nIf you have any questions or want to connect, feel
